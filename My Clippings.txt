For decades, experts had assumed that drug addicts—laudanum lushes, poppy tea drinkers, and opiate addicts—were predisposed to the condition, somehow wired incorrectly. Olds and Milner were some of the first researchers to turn that idea on its head—to suggest that, perhaps, under the right circumstances, we could all become addicts.

Routtenberg wondered if this might tell us something about addiction in humans. But perhaps anyone could descend into oblivion like Rat No. 34. “We started to think of addiction as a form of learning. You can think of addiction as part of memory,” says Routtenberg. Addicts had simply learned to link a particular behavior with an appealing outcome. For Rat No. 34, this was stimulation of his pleasure center; for a heroin addict, the flush of pleasure from a fresh hit.

Both Cleopatra and the soldiers showed that Routtenberg was right: addiction embeds itself in memory. For Cleopatra, the cage was a trigger. It transported her back to the time when she had been an addict, and she couldn’t help falling back on old habits. The lucky Vietnam vets never confronted those memories, because once they left Vietnam they escaped the cues that went along with the act of shooting up.

Isaac told me that the most dangerous time for an addict is the first moment when things are going so well that you believe you’ve left the addiction behind forever. “You’re convinced that you’re fixed, so you can go back to doing what you were doing before. I let my guard down, and a buddy of mine sent me a text message that said, ‘Hey, you wanna play with us a little bit?’ And I went, ‘Hey, sure!’”

it was much less as religious doctrine than as political institution that Christianity aroused such fanatical hatred. It did so not because priests claimed to govern the other world but because they were landowners, feudal lords, tithe collectors, and administrators in this one; not because the Church had no place in the new society that the people were about to institute but because it occupied the most privileged and powerful place in the old society, which was to be dashed to pieces.

For millennia, blue light existed only during the daytime. Candles and wood fires produced reddish-yellow light, and there was no artificial lighting at night. Firelight isn’t a problem, because the brain interprets red light as a signal for bedtime. Blue light is a different story, because it signals morning.

Once sleep is under way, melatonin slowly decreases in concentration across the night and into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the eyes (even through the closed lids), a brake pedal is applied to the pineal gland, thereby shutting off the release of melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain and body that the finish line of sleep has been reached.

Caffeine works by successfully battling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine welcome sites—or receptors—in the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, however, it does not stimulate them like adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively inactivates the receptors, acting as a masking agent. It’s the equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears to shut out a sound. By hijacking and occupying these receptors, caffeine blocks the sleepiness signal normally communicated to the brain by adenosine. The upshot: caffeine tricks you into feeling alert and awake, despite the high levels of adenosine that would otherwise seduce you into sleep.

We now understand why. For the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the sleepiness chemical it blocks (adenosine) nevertheless continues to build up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep-encouraging adenosine, however, because the wall of caffeine you’ve created is holding it back from your perception.

All these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it is here, in the sensory convergence zone, where that journey ends while you sleep. The signals are blocked by a perceptual barricade set up in a structure called the thalamus (THAL-uh-muhs).

As we will discover in chapter 6, a key function of deep NREM sleep, which predominates early in the night, is to do the work of weeding out and removing unnecessary neural connections. In contrast, the dreaming stage of REM sleep, which prevails later in the night, plays a role in strengthening those connections.

As is the case when you are awake, the sensory gate of the thalamus once again swings open during REM sleep. But the nature of the gate is different. It is not sensations from the outside that are allowed to journey to the cortex during REM sleep. Rather, signals of emotions, motivations, and memories (past and present) are all played out on the big screens of our visual, auditory, and kinesthetic sensory cortices in the brain.

Essa inquietação a tal ponto lhe parece, na verdade, ultrapassar as categorias do raciocínio, que ele pensa unicamente nela e não fala de outra coisa. Enumera suas faces: de tédio, quando o homem comum procura nivelá-la com ele mesmo, e mitigá-la; de terror, quando o espírito contempla a morte.

Em todos esses casos, do mais simples ao mais complexo, a absurdidade será tanto maior quanto mais crescer o afastamento entre os termos da minha comparação. Há casamentos absurdos, desafios, rancores, silêncios, guerras e até acordos de paz. Para cada um deles, a absurdidade nasce de uma comparação.

Tenho base, portanto, para dizer que o sentimento da absurdidade não nasce do simples exame de um fato ou impressão mas que ele brota da comparação entre um estado de fato e uma certa realidade, entre uma ação e o mundo que a ultrapassa. O absurdo essencialmente é um divórcio. Não está nem num nem noutro dos elementos comparados: nasce de sua confrontação.

O problema é saber como sair disso e se o suicida deve se subtrair desse absurdo. A primeira - e, no fundo, a única - condição das minhas pesquisas é a de preservar aquilo mesmo que me esmaga, e de respeitar, consequentemente, o que julgo haver ali de essencial. Acabo de defini-lo como uma confrontação e uma luta sem descanso.

Mas, ao mesmo tempo, o homem absurdo compreende que, até ali, ele estava ligado a esse postulado de liberdade com cuja ilusão vinha vivendo. De certo modo, isso o atrapalhava.

À primeira vista, os místicos encontram uma liberdade para se dar. Absorvendo-se em seu deus, consentindo em suas regras, eles se tornam secretamente livres a seu modo. É na escravidão espontaneamente consentida que eles reencontram uma independência profunda. Mas que significa essa liberdade? Pode-se dizer, sobretudo, que eles se sentem livres diante de si mesmos e menos livres do que, sobretudo, libertados.

A crença no sentido da vida compreende sempre uma escala de valores, uma escolha, preferências. A crença no absurdo, segundo as nossas definições, ensina o oposto. Mas nisso vale a pena que nos detenhamos. Saber se alguém pode viver sem apelação é tudo o que me interessa. Não quero sair nem um pouco desse ponto. Sendo-me assim manifesta essa fisionomia da vida, tenho como me acomodar a ela? Ora, em face dessa preocupação especial, a crença no absurdo passa a substituir a qualidade das experiências pela quantidade. Se me convenço que essa vida não tem outra face além da do absurdo, se comprovo que todo o seu equilíbrio depende dessa permanente oposição entre a minha revolta consciente e a obscuridade em que ela se debate se admito que a minha liberdade só tem sentido na relação com o seu destino limitado, então eu tenho de dizer que o que vale não é viver melhor mas viver mais. Não preciso me perguntar se isso é vulgar ou enfadonho, elegante ou lamentável.

This is why clutter is dangerous. It’s easy to be seduced by the small amounts of profit offered by the latest app or service, but then forget its cost in terms of the most important resource we possess: the minutes of our life.

Those who are committed to the digital status quo might attempt to cast this philosophy as somehow anti-technology. I hope I’ve convinced you in this book that this claim is misguided. Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools.

Gerações têm trabalhado em empregos que odeiam para poder comprar coisas de que realmente não precisam. − Não temos uma grande guerra em nossa geração ou uma grande depressão, mas na verdade temos, sim, é uma grande guerra de espírito.

No fim do ano fomos surpreendidos com a ligação do Jorge Davidson, diretor artístico da EMI-Odeon. O Herbert tinha dado a ele uma fita cassete com umas músicas do Renato. O Jorge ligou para o nosso vocalista e disse: “Venham fazer uma demo aqui na EMI.” Nós seríamos a primeira banda de Brasília a pisar em uma gravadora do Sudeste. O Renato estava eufórico e foi ele mesmo quem chamou a Fernanda para ser a nossa empresária. Em dezembro, todos nós fomos para o Rio. Foi um verão cheio de expectativas.

Nas discussões, a Fernanda era obrigada a ouvir: “Eu sou o Renato Russo, e tenha medo!” Patético. Até que, em Santa Maria, em mais um chilique, ele bateu a porta do camarim nas costas da minha mulher. O Renato, no melhor estilo babaca pop star, tinha ficado putinho quando descobriu que a Fernanda não tinha comprado o leite que ele havia lhe pedido antes da apresentação. Quando eu vi aquela cena, pensei: “Vou matar esse cara.” Acabei estourando e gritando com ele: “Você é um babaca, um escroto filho da puta!” A Fernanda estava com a saúde fragilizada naqueles dias por causa de uma cirurgia de última hora, e o Renato agiu como um covarde calculista. Depois ele veio se desculpar conosco, simulando com aquela voz infantil que ele costumava fazer: “Tia, descuuuuulpas....” Mas o clima tinha ficado ruim, e foi a partir desse episódio que a Fernanda decidiu abandonar o barco, com o meu total apoio e compreensão. Ela achava que esse fato tinha aberto um precedente grave, e não sabia o que poderia acontecer a partir dali.

O lado B não faz por menos. “1965 (Duas tribos)” aborda o tema da ditadura militar, uma forte lembrança da infância. Frases como “Cortaram meus braços/ Cortaram minhas mãos/ Cortaram minhas pernas/ Num dia de verão (...)/ Podia ser meu pai/ Podia ser meu irmão” são uma clara referencia à tortura. Há também menção à luta armada, que contou com a adesão, principalmente, de estudantes: “Mataram um menino/ Tinha arma de verdade/ Tinha arma nenhuma/ Tinha arma de brinquedo.” E os slogans ufanistas dos anos 1960 e 1970 foram alvo da ironia do Renato: “O Brasil é o país do futuro.” Nos shows, o Renato costumava interromper a execução da música quando essas palavras eram cantadas, e fazia troça com elas. Isso está registrado no CD As quatro estações ao vivo.

As rádios veiculavam uma versão ao vivo de “Meninos e meninas”, que era antecedida por um recado do nosso vocalista: “Eu amo quem eu quiser!” Nessa época, o Renato assumiu que era gay, em entrevistas a jornais e revistas. Nos LPs anteriores, ele tinha abordado o tema de forma codificada. “Soldados” (“Tenho medo de lhe dizer o que eu quero tanto”) e “Daniel na cova dos leões” (“Faço nosso o meu segredo mais sincero”) haviam sido dicas para bons entendedores.

A super-romântica “Os barcos” se relaciona com um capricho do Renato: ele sempre quis fazer uma canção que falasse em “um outro alguém”, como “Someone else”, do Jimmy Webb, cantada pelo Art Garfunkel no LP Watermark (1977).

O Bonfá veio com “Longe do meu lado”, que motivou um comentário engraçado do nosso vocalista, em 1996, encontrado no livro Renato Russo de A a Z (Letra Livre, 2000), da Simone Assad: “Ah, a sacarina do Bonfá (...) Aí, todo mundo acha que eu é que faço essas músicas, e que eu é que sou o melancólico do grupo.”

A pseudociência difere da ciência errônea. A ciência prospera com seus erros, eliminando-os um a um. Conclusões falsas são tiradas todo o tempo, mas elas constituem tentativas. As hipóteses são formuladas de modo a poderem ser refutadas. Uma seqüência de hipóteses alternativas é confrontada com os experimentos e a observação. A ciência tateia e cambaleia em busca de melhor compreensão. Alguns sentimentos de propriedade individual são certamente ofendidos quando uma hipótese científica não é aprovada, mas essas refutações são reconhecidas como centrais para o empreendimento científico. A pseudociência é exatamente o oposto. As hipóteses são formuladas de modo a se tornar invulneráveis a qualquer experimento que ofereça uma perspectiva de refutação, para que em princípio não possam ser invalidadas. Os profissionais são defensivos e cautelosos. Faz-se oposição ao escrutínio cético. Quando a hipótese pseudocientífica não consegue entusiasmar os cientistas, deduz-se que há conspirações para eliminá-la.

Considerem-se então duas possibilidades: que Aurora existe e que ela não existe. Se existe, é impressionante que se tenha tentado encobrir oficialmente a sua existência, que o sigilo tenha sido tão eficaz, e que a aeronave tenha sido testada ou reabastecida em todo o mundo, sem que uma única fotografia ou qualquer outra evidência sólida fosse publicada. Por outro lado, se Aurora não existe, é impressionante que um mito tenha se propagado com tanta força e ido tão longe. Por que as insistentes negativas oficiais têm tido tão pouco peso? A própria existência de um nome — Aurora, nesse caso — não serviria para rotular uma série de fenômenos diversos? De uma ou de outra forma, Aurora parece relevante para os UFOs.

[V]amos imaginar um homem de pé, ao lado do vidro da janela fechada e em frente a sua lareira, olhando para o jardim ao crepúsculo. Está tão absorto na visão do mundo exterior que deixa de visualizar o interior da sala. Quando se torna mais escuro lá fora, no entanto, o reflexo indistinto das imagens dos objetos às suas costas pode ser visto no vidro da janela. Por algum tempo, ele consegue ver o jardim (se fixa os olhos ao longe) ou o reflexo do interior da sala (se focaliza o vidro a alguns centímetros de seu rosto). A noite cai, mas o fogo ainda arde brilhantemente na lareira e ilumina a sala. O observador agora vê no vidro o reflexo nítido do interior da sala às suas costas, que parece estar no lado de fora da janela. Essa ilusão se torna mais vaga à medida que o fogo esmorece, e, finalmente, quando fica escuro tanto lá fora como dentro da sala, nada mais se vê. Se o fogo se aviva de tempos em tempos, as visões no vidro reaparecem. De forma análoga, as experiências alucinatórias, assim como as dos sonhos normais, ocorrem quando se reduz a “luz do dia” (dados sensoriais de entrada), ao passo que a “iluminação interior” (o nível geral da excitação mental) permanece “brilhante”, e as imagens que se originam dentro das “salas” de nossas mentes podem ser percebidas (alucinadas) como se viessem de fora das “janelas” de nossos sentidos. Outra analogia poderia ser a de que os sonhos, como as estrelas, brilham o tempo todo. Embora as estrelas não sejam vistas com muita freqüência à luz do dia, pois o brilho do Sol é demasiado intenso, se há um eclipse solar, ou se o espectador decide observar o firmamento um pouco depois do pôr-do-sol ou um pouco antes do amanhecer, ou se ele é acordado de tempos em tempos numa noite clara para fitar o céu, então as estrelas, como os sonhos, embora freqüentemente esquecidas, podem ser sempre vistas. Um conceito mais relacionado com a mente é o de uma atividade contínua de processamento de informações (uma espécie de “fluxo pré-consciente”), influenciada ininterruptamente tanto pelas forças conscientes como pelas inconscientes, que constitui o suprimento potencial do conteúdo dos sonhos. O sonho é uma experiência durante a qual, por alguns minutos, o indivíduo tem alguma consciência do fluxo de dados sendo processado. As alucinações em estado desperto também implicariam os mesmos fenômenos, produzidos por um conjunto um pouco diferente de circunstâncias psicológicas ou fisiológicas [...]. Todo comportamento e experiência humanos (normal e anormal) parecem ser bem assistidos por fenômenos ilusórios e alucinatórios. Embora a relação desses fenômenos com a doença mental seja bem documentada, o seu papel na vida cotidiana não foi talvez suficientemente considerado. Uma compreensão mais aprofundada das ilusões e alucinações das pessoas normais pode fornecer explicações para experiências que do contrário ficam relegadas ao estranho, ao “extra-sensorial”, ou ao sobrenatural.

Platão, o discípulo mais famoso de Sócrates, atribuía um papel elevado aos demônios: “Nenhuma natureza humana investida de poder supremo é capaz de ordenar os assuntos humanos”, diz ele, “sem transbordar de insolência e iniqüidade...”. Não nomeamos bois para ser os senhores dos bois, nem bodes para ser os senhores dos bodes, mas somos nós próprios, uma raça superior, que os governamos. De maneira semelhante, Deus, por amor à humanidade, colocou acima de nós os demônios, que são uma raça superior, e eles, de forma fácil e prazerosa para si mesmos, e não menos prazerosa para nós, tornam as tribos dos homens felizes e unidas, ao cuidar de nós e nos dar paz, reverência, ordem e justiça que nunca falham.

Onde elas fracassam, você tem de prosperar. Ser o que as pessoas têm medo de ser. Tornar-se a pessoa que elas admiram.

O mundo, considerado como representação, único ponto de vista que aqui nos ocupa, compreende duas metades essenciais, necessárias e inseparáveis. A primeira é o objeto que tem por forma o espaço e o tempo, e por conseguinte, a pluralidade; a segunda é o sujeito que escapa à dupla lei do tempo e do espaço, sendo sempre uno e indivisível em cada ser que percebe.

Mas ele acertou em cheio quando pressentiu a condição de quase obsolescência da mulher. Entre flats com serviço de quarto, restaurante no térreo, garotas de programa de alto nível e namoradas independentes, a mulher como objeto de amor e enlouquecimento aos poucos se torna desnecessária. Já que elas são antes de tudo boas “profissionais” voltadas para sua carreira, melhor uma relação “profissional” limpa e reta, na qual não temos que arcar com os dramas femininos.

Como fazer uma esquerda democrática sem grandes assembleias de assassinos que babam de ódio por todo mundo que tem mais sucesso na vida do que eles? Não existe esquerda democrática, isso é uma mentira retórica, a não ser que democracia seja apenas a violência da maioria sobre todos os outros. Democracia de linchamentos.

Preciso entrar em quadra sem nenhum peso extra. Porque é assim que o tênis funciona. Todos os pontos anteriores podem ter sido fracassos, mas no momento que você desiste de prestar atenção e desiste de correr atrás da próxima bola, você está entregando a partida.

Fora os ídolos esculpidos, qual é o erro do idólatra? É adorar sua própria capacidade, esquecendo que somos seres insuficientes, isto é, que não detemos em nós mesmos as condições para superar a morte ou encontrar o sentido da vida. No âmbito da Bíblia hebraica, o personagem Deus marca justamente o limite absoluto à nossa suficiência. Viver com Ele significa tomarmos consciência dessa nossa insuficiência essencial.

A idolatria é a arte máxima de quem vive sob a égide do medo. E, para deixarmos de ter medo, como dirá o Novo Testamento, temos que perder o medo de perder nossa vida. Isso não significa apenas perder o medo de morrer, mas também não desesperar diante da contingência que nos cerca.

Esse detalhe do filme mostra fina compreensão da relação entre o Deus israelita e quem O invoca da maneira justa: com o coração reto, sem medo de mostrar aquilo que sente, sem querer agradar para conseguir o que deseja. Deus detesta quem se finge de “bonzinho”. Ele prefere o pecador desesperado.

O importante no livro é a atitude de Abraão, ou seja, como está seu coração nessa subida. O profeta sabe que nem as sensações (estágio estético, na classificação de Kierkegaard), nem as normas de conduta exteriores (estágio ético), nem as doutrinas eclesiais de comportamento (estágio religioso 1) podem salvar o homem de seu abismo (seu vazio, sua falta de sentido, sua agonia). Apenas o “salto na fé” (estágio religioso 11) pode nos tirar desse desespero que é a consciência humana, na qual a angústia é substância psíquica e não afeto, segundo o filósofo.

Em A Negação da Morte (1973), o antropólogo Ernest Becker (1924-1974) diz que nossa espécie teve que lutar para sobreviver à violência da adaptação tanto no meio ambiente externo quanto no interno, feito da vida psíquica. Símbolos e significados constituem um verdadeiro emaranhado na floresta densa que é a vida psíquica, com seus sonhos, seus pesadelos, suas angústias, suas esperanças e seus medos (em particular o medo da morte, que é o tema de Becker).

A fase final de amadurecimento, conhecida como velhice, é um terreno excepcionalmente fértil para as tentativas de alívio da pressão do tempo “no corpo e na alma”. O mundo contemporâneo exerce uma enorme pressão sobre a velhice, ao excluir os idosos do universo de valores, ao mesmo tempo que estende a duração da vida utilizando técnicas médicas e aumentando assim a incidência de depressão nos idosos.

Atualmente, muitas pessoas buscam obter nos feriados ou finais de semana instantes de lazer que as ajudem a “ver a vida com outros olhos”. Porém, com o avançar da vida pós-moderna e suas exigências cada vez maiores de sucesso (no trabalho, no afeto, no sexo, na saúde e na política), mesmo esses momentos de lazer são paulatinamente ocupados pela atividade do trabalho ou se transformam em intervalos de satisfação ligados às obrigações comuns, como a distração com as crianças, as viagens turísticas, os jantares inteligentes, ou seja, ações que dificilmente distanciam de fato as pessoas do cotidiano.

Santificar o dia em que Deus descansou após a Criação é entender a necessidade de “pararmos a semana” para pensar Nele e na história maior da existência humana, a fim de nos mantermos humanos.

Os valores, aquilo que consideramos certo ou errado, têm algum fundamento ou justificativa universal, irredutível, ou são meras convenções que podem ser modificadas conforme as culturas e as modas de cada época? Essa pergunta atormentou diferentes pensadores, como Platão, Aristóteles, Santo Agostinho, Montaigne, Descartes, Pascal, Hume, Kant... A lista é gigantesca. Para horror de muitos, contudo, não há fundamento evidente para valor algum. Por isso, a ancestralidade dos hábitos sempre foi uma chave essencial para constituir o modo como as pessoas têm vivido até hoje.

A modernidade, ao devastar a crença no saber ancestral, agravou esse problema: como crer que algo seja verdade, inclusive no campo moral ou do comportamento? Kant perdeu o sono por causa dessa questão. Alguns perdem até hoje.

Por exemplo, como diria Pascal, o rei é rei apenas porque decidiram um dia que o primogênito da rainha seria assim chamado, e não porque a figura real contenha algum sentido superior. A realeza se origina em um fato banal e contingente.

O tema da excessiva erotização das meninas aqui se associa a uma dura indagação: se o homem que criou a jovem não é seu pai biológico, ele poderá ceder às provocações sexuais da filha? E pior ainda: haveria algum problema se o pai biológico e sua filha se entregassem ao desejo mútuo, desde que evitassem a gravidez? Talvez um dia cheguemos a encontrar nobres professores de ciências sociais que dirão que a proibição do incesto é fruto das “relações de poder” e que pessoas livres e autônomas podem, sim, se relacionar sexualmente, mesmo se forem pai e filha, ou mãe e filho.

misericórdia com a humanidade inteira, que, entretanto, O traiu, como ocorreu com Adão e Eva; ou com Caim, que matou seu irmão Abel; ou com Nimrod, que construiu Babel; ou com os hebreus, que fizeram o bezerro de ouro logo após a libertação da escravidão do Egito; ou mesmo com Jesus, que foi traído e abandonado por seus apóstolos. Fosse Deus apenas justo, conforme a lei de talião, não haveria humanidade: Ele teria feito cumprir o “olho por olho, dente por dente”.

Além de retirar do criminoso, o que é óbvio, a possibilidade de tomar consciência do mal que fez. A impossibilidade do perdão torna o mundo cruel em vários sentidos, e por isso o episódio se passa em uma cidade feia, suja e cheia de pessoas autocentradas. A “simples” justiça não basta para lidarmos com o Mal.

diz que quando falamos do Bem sempre devemos cuidar para não fazer isso no meio de muita gente. A razão é simples, segundo o poeta: os maus sentimentos, a mentira e a falsidade são mais frequentes nas pessoas. Do Bem deve-se falar para poucos, pois, segundo Brodsky, quando se multiplica o número de pessoas, é grande a possibilidade de os maus sentimentos se multiplicarem na mesma proporção. Daí o silêncio e o cuidado que o Bem pede.

A pureza semita é cozida na agonia de um homem ou de uma mulher que se sabem o tempo todo jogados diante de um Deus zeloso da verdade da alma de cada um. No hebraísmo, pureza é movimento, e não repouso.

A razão disso é que ela consegue ter uma visão clara daquilo que nela é graça e do que é impureza. Quanto mais alguém se sente distante de Deus, mais perto de fato está, porque essa distância é, na verdade, a autopercepção do que falta para atingir a pureza. Quanto mais alguém se sente perto de Deus, mais longe está, porque essa proximidade é signo de sua falsidade, ou seja, de seu pecado contra a castidade. A bondade dos bons sempre faz mal porque é, normalmente, fruto do descuido com sua própria maldade.

O amor, contudo, é incognoscível, como nos ensina Kierkegaard, quando diz que só se pode conhecê-lo por seus frutos. E seus frutos sempre brotam em um mundo oposto ao mundo do medo. Para amar é preciso ter coragem. E o amor é irmão da esperança improvável. Pois toda esperança que importa é improvável.

E lembrar-me que os sonhos de então eram tristes, e embora não fosse melhor, de algum modo sentia que viver era mais fácil, mais tranquilo, que não havia esse pensamento negro que agora se apegou a mim; que não havia esses remorsos, esses remorsos lúgubres e sombrios que agora não dão descanso nem de dia nem de noite. E me pergunto: onde é que estão os seus sonhos? E balançando a cabeça, digo: como os anos voam depressa! E novamente me pergunto: mas o que você fez dos seus anos? Onde sepultou a sua melhor época? Você viveu ou não? Veja, digo a mim mesmo, veja como o mundo está ficando frio. Ainda passarão anos, e atrás deles virá a solidão sombria, virá a velhice trêmula com uma bengala, e atrás dela a tristeza e a melancolia.

Não existe cura para a causa do ressentimento, existem modos distintos para nos relacionarmos com ele. Não há cura para uma verdade, apenas modos de enfrentá-la ou de evitá-la.

ressentimento por seu nome e seus atributos: inveja de quem é melhor, sentimento sufocante de que eu tenho o “direito” de ser melhor do que ele é, conclusão aterrizadora de que não sou.

O complexo de Salieri é universal: todo mundo encontra seu Amadeus na vida, e sofre por isso. Um Amadeus é alguém que é melhor do que nós. Principalmente quando ele parece fazer sem nenhum esforço e de uma maneira muito melhor o que nos esforçamos para fazer. O ressentimento brotará do fundo de nossa alma como um veneno. Vejamos o que acontece no filme.

Uma mania contemporânea é dizer que homens bem resolvidos veem a beleza interior feminina. Mentira. Homens levam tempo para ver a beleza interior numa mulher, e elas sabem disso muito bem, por isso se enfeitam, quero dizer, as normais. Para chegar na beleza interior da mulher, o homem deve já ter se cansado um pouco da beleza física dela.

Nossos descendentes, como arqueólogos que vasculham cacos e fragmentos, buscarão sinais dos restos que deixarmos, perguntando-se a razão de termos confundido expectativas com esperanças, de termos escolhido o marketing moral dos amadores em Filosofia como ciência da vida prática, quando já Aristóteles sabia que toda moral é uma ciência da contingência e na contingência. E a contingência é o nome do horror ao nosso abandono. Qualquer ciência exata nessa área será apenas uma matemática da mentira.

Só há um luxo para eles, o das relações humanas. Como não entender que, nesse universo vulnerável, tudo o que é humano e apenas humano adquire um sentido mais ardente? Rostos tensos, fraternidade ameaçada, amizade tão forte e tão pudica dos homens entre si, estas são as verdadeiras riquezas, porque são perecíveis.

Não é, então, indiferente para terminar de encontrar os principais temas deste ensaio no universo magnífico e pueril do criador. Seria um erro ver aqui um símbolo e acreditar que a obra de arte possa ser considerada um refúgio diante do absurdo. Ela é em si mesma um fenômeno absurdo e a questão é apenas descrevê-lo. Não oferece uma saída para o mal do espírito. É, ao contrário, um dos sinais desse mal, que o repercute em todo o pensamento de um homem. Mas, pela primeira vez, tira o espírito de si mesmo e o coloca diante de outro, não para que se perca, mas para mostrar-lhe com um dedo preciso o caminho sem saída em que todos estão

Se matar uma criança inocente, você será castigado de alguma forma, mesmo que a lei humana não descubra? Se você for castigado, obrigado a “pagar” pelo que fez, o mundo tem sentido moral (suficiente); se não, ele não tem sentido moral (insuficiente). Se, ao roubar e se dar bem ao final, seu ato não for cobrado de você em alguma instância (Deus, reencarnação, etc.), o mundo não tem sentido moral. Se os honestos (que respondem à angústia moral que demanda justiça na sociedade) no mundo, ao final da vida, forem recompensados, e os desonestos ficarem infelizes, o mundo faz sentido, mesmo que sem instâncias divinas em jogo. Uma das palavras comuns para descrever esse sentimento de falta de sentido moral do mundo (insuficiência moral do mundo) é niilismo.

Tudo nessa vida acaba em bagatela e aquele que, para agradar aos outros se mata trabalhando por dinheiro, honras ou o que for, sem que a isso o mova sua própria paixão ou necessidade, é, com certeza, um tolo.

Some of my favorite songs: 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart' by Neil Young; 'Last Night I Dreamed That Somebody Loved Me' by the Smiths; 'Call Me' by Aretha Franklin; 'I Don't Want to Talk About It' by anybody. And then there's 'Love Hurts' and 'When Love Breaks Down' and 'How Can You Mend a Broken Heart' and 'The Speed of the Sound of Loneliness' and 'She's Gone' and 'I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself 'and . . . some of these songs I have listened to around once a week, on average (three hundred times in the first month, every now and again thereafter), since I was sixteen or nineteen or twenty-one. How can that not leave you bruised somewhere? How can that not turn you into the sort of person liable to break into little bits when your first love goes all wrong? What came first, the music or the misery? Did I listen to music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to music? Do all those records turn you into a melancholy person?

In one respect, this would be something to celebrate; the children of the working class would at last compete fairly, side by side with the children of the privileged. But it would not, Young thought, be an unmitigated triumph; for it was bound to foster hubris in the winners and humiliation among the losers. The winners would consider their success a “just reward for their own capacity, for their own efforts, for their own undeniable achievement,” and would therefore look down on those less successful than themselves. Those who failed to rise would feel they had no one to blame but themselves. 15

From the distance of our scientific age, this way of thinking may seem innocent, even childlike. But it is not as distant as it first appears. In fact, this outlook is the origin of meritocratic thinking. It reflects the belief that the moral universe is arranged in a way that aligns prosperity with merit and suffering with wrongdoing. This is not far from the familiar contemporary view that wealth signifies talent and hard work and that poverty signifies indolence.

“The fortunate [person] is seldom satisfied with the fact of being fortunate,” Max Weber observed. “Beyond this, he needs to know that he has a right to his good fortune. He wants to be convinced that he ‘deserves’ it, and above all, that he deserves it in comparison with others. He wishes to be allowed the belief that the less fortunate also merely experience [their] due.” 20

To be sure, markets do not necessarily rest on meritocratic assumptions. The most familiar arguments for markets are about utility and freedom. The first argues that markets create incentives that boost GDP and maximize the general welfare; the second argues that markets leave people free to choose what value to place on the goods they exchange. But the market triumphalism of the 1980s prompted the articulation of a third, meritocratic rationale: Provided they operate within a fair system of equal opportunity, markets give people what they deserve. As long as everyone has an equal chance to compete, market outcomes reward merit.

Here then was the argument of center-left, market-friendly liberalism from the 1990s to 2016: Enabling everyone to compete on equal terms was not only compatible with a market society but a way to fulfill its underlying principles. Two such principles were fairness and productivity. Eliminating discrimination and expanding opportunity would make markets more fair, and enlisting a wider pool of talent would make markets more productive. (Bill Clinton often advanced the fairness argument under cover of the productivity argument, as when he said, “We don’t have a person to waste.”) 2

This is how Trump voters may have heard Hillary Clinton’s meritocratic mantra. For them, the rhetoric of rising was more insulting than inspiring.

The tyranny of merit arises from more than the rhetoric of rising. It consists in a cluster of attitudes and circumstances that, taken together, have made meritocracy toxic. First, under conditions of rampant inequality and stalled mobility, reiterating the message that we are responsible for our fate and deserve what we get erodes solidarity and demoralizes those left behind by globalization. Second, insisting that a college degree is the primary route to a respectable job and a decent life creates a credentialist prejudice that undermines the dignity of work and demeans those who have not been to college; and third, insisting that social and political problems are best solved by highly educated, value-neutral experts is a technocratic conceit that corrupts democracy and disempowers ordinary citizens.

But the American faith in the ability to rise through effort and grit no longer fits the facts on the ground. In the decades following World War II, Americans could expect that their children would do better, economically, than they had. Today, this is no longer the case. Of children born in the 1940s, almost all (90 percent) earned more than their parents. Of children born in the 1980s, only half surpassed their parents’ earnings. 36

Some of my students argue that, even if the American dream is at odds with the facts, it is important not to spread the news; better to preserve the myth so that people will continue to believe it is possible to rise as far as their talents and hard work will take them. This would turn the American dream into what Plato described as a “noble lie,” a belief that, though untrue, sustains civic harmony by inducing citizens to accept certain inequalities as legitimate. In Plato’s case, it was the myth that God created people with different metals in their souls, giving divine sanction to an arrangement in which a guardian class led by a philosopher-king governs the city. 43  In our case, it would be the myth that, in America, despite the sizable gap between rich and poor, even those on the bottom can make it if they try.

If meritocracy is an aspiration, those who fall short can always blame the system; but if meritocracy is a fact, those who fall short are invited to blame themselves.

Before we slept together, there was at least some pretense that it was something we both wanted to do, that it was the healthy, strong beginning of an exciting new relationship. Now all the pretense seems to have gone, and we're left to face the fact that we're sitting here because we don't know anybody else we could be sitting with.

Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship. Maybe Al Green is directly responsible for more than I ever realized.

A verdadeira interiorização leva a uma universalidade inacessível àqueles que não alcançam a essência e para quem o lirismo não passa de um fenômeno inferior, produto de uma inconsistência espiritual, quando os recursos líricos da subjetividade testemunham, na realidade, uma frescura e uma profundidade das mais remarcáveis.

A chave está, provavelmente, na irracionalidade da vida, que faz com que ela se mantenha sem razão. E se houvessem somente razões absurdas para se viver? O mundo não merece que a gente se sacrifique por uma ideia ou uma crença. Nós somos mais felizes hoje porque outros o fizeram para nosso bem? Que bem? Se alguém sacrificou-se verdadeiramente para que eu fosse mais feliz no presente, eu sou, na verdade, mais infeliz do que ele, pois não concordo em fundar minha existência sobre um cemitério.

Eis o que pensei: para que o mais banal dos acontecimentos se torne uma aventura, é preciso e basta que nos ponhamos a narrá-lo. É isso que ilude as pessoas: um homem é sempre um narrador de histórias, vive rodeado por suas histórias e pelas histórias dos outros, vê tudo o que lhe acontece através delas; e procura viver sua vida como se a narrasse.

Quando se vive, nada acontece. Os cenários mudam, as pessoas entram e saem, eis tudo. Nunca há começos. Os dias se sucedem aos dias, sem rima nem razão: é uma soma monótona e interminável. De quando em quando se procede a um total parcial, dizendo: faz três anos que viajo, três anos que estou em Bouville. Também não há fim: nunca deixamos uma mulher, um amigo, uma cidade, de uma só vez. E também tudo se parece: Xangai, Moscou, Argel, ao fim de 15 dias é tudo igual. Por alguns momentos — raramente — avaliamos a situação, percebemos que nos envolvemos com uma mulher, que nos metemos numa confusão. Por um átimo. Depois disso o desfile recomeça, voltamos a fazer as contas das horas e dos dias. Segunda, terça, quarta. Abril, maio, junho. 1924, 1925, 1926.

Nunca achou que tivesse o menor direito sobre os outros nem estes sobre ele: considera injustificadas e gratuitas as dádivas que a vida lhe propicia. Liga-se fortemente a tudo, mas se desvincula com facilidade.

Então é isso a Náusea: essa evidência ofuscante? Como quebrei a cabeça! Como escrevi a respeito dela! Agora sei: Existo — o mundo existe — e sei que o mundo existe. Isso é tudo. Mas tanto faz para mim. É estranho que tudo me seja tão indiferente: isso me assusta. Foi a partir do famigerado dia em que quis fazer ricocheteios. Ia atirar o seixo, olhei para ele, foi então que tudo começou: senti que ele existia. E a seguir, depois disso, houve outras Náuseas; de quando em quando os objetos se põem a existir em nossa mão. Houve a Náusea do Rendez-vous des Cheminots e depois uma outra, antes, uma noite em que eu olhava pela janela; e depois mais outra no jardim público, um domingo, e depois outras. Mas nunca tinha sido tão forte como hoje.

Tudo é gratuito: esse jardim, essa cidade e eu próprio. Quando ocorre que nos apercebamos disso, sentimos o estômago embrulhado, e tudo se põe a flutuar como na outra noite no Rendez-vous des Cheminots: é isso a Náusea; é isso que os Salafrários — os do Coteau Vert e os outros — tentam esconder de si mesmos com sua ideia de direito.

Será que poderia tentar... Naturalmente não se trataria de uma música... mas será que não poderia, num outro gênero? Teria que ser um livro: não sei fazer outra coisa. Mas não um livro de história, isso fala do que existiu — jamais um ente pode justificar a existência de outro ente. Meu erro foi querer ressuscitar o sr. de Rollebon. Outro tipo de livro. Não sei bem qual — mas seria preciso que se adivinhasse, por trás das palavras impressas, por trás das páginas, algo que não existisse, que estaria acima da existência. Uma história, por exemplo, como as que não podem acontecer, uma aventura. Seria preciso que fosse bela e dura como aço e que fizesse com que as pessoas se envergonhassem de sua existência.

A questão fundamental é que não convém evitar as dificuldades e reduzir tudo a um nível simplista; é extremamente importante, então, que a mise en scène, em vez de ilustrar alguma idéia, exprima a vida — o caráter dos personagens e seu estado psicológico. Seu objetivo não deve reduzir-se a uma elaboração do significado de um diálogo ou de uma seqüência de cenas. Sua função é surpreender-nos pela autenticidade das ações e pela beleza e profundidade das imagens artísticas — e não através da ilustração por demais

Nenhuma mise en scène tem o direito de se repetir, da mesma forma que duas personalidades jamais serão idênticas. Assim que uma mise en scène transformar-se num signo, num clichê, num conceito (por mais originais que possam ser), a coisa toda — personagens, situações, psicologia — torna-se falsa e artificial.

Meu ponto de vista é certamente subjetivo, mas é assim que as coisas devem ser na arte: em sua obra, o artista decompõe a realidade no prisma da sua percepção e usa uma técnica pessoal de escorço para mostrar os mais diversos aspectos da realidade.

A arte não raciocina em termos lógicos, nem formula uma lógica do comportamento; ela expressa o seu próprio postulado de fé. Se, na ciência, é possível confirmar a veracidade dos argumentos e comprová-los logicamente aos que a eles se opõem, na arte é impossível convencer qualquer pessoa de que você está certo, caso as imagens criadas a tenham deixado indiferente e não tenham sido capazes de convencê-la a aceitar uma verdade recém-descoberta sobre o mundo e o homem, se, na verdade, a pessoa ficou apenas entediada ao deparar-se com a obra.

Ainda que eu falasse as línguas dos homens e dos anjos, e não tivesse caridade, seria como o metal que soa ou como o sino que tine. E ainda que tivesse o dom de profecia, e conhecesse todos os mistérios e toda a ciência, e ainda que tivesse toda a fé, de maneira tal que transportasse os montes, e não tivesse caridade, nada seria. E ainda que distribuísse toda a minha fortuna para sustento dos pobres, e ainda que entregasse o meu corpo para ser queimado, e não tivesse caridade, nada disso me aproveitaria. A caridade é sofredora, é benigna; a caridade não é invejosa; a caridade não trata com leviandade, não se ensoberbece. Não se porta com indecência, não busca os seus interesses, não se irrita, não suspeita mal; Não folga com a injustiça, mas folga com a verdade; Tudo sofre, tudo crê, tudo espera, tudo suporta. A caridade nunca falha; mas havendo profecias, serão aniquiladas; havendo línguas, cessarão; havendo ciência, desaparecerá.

" A s obras dos grandes poetas nunca foram lidas pela humanidade, pois somente os grandes poetas são capazes de lê-las. Elas só foram lidas da mesma maneira que as multidões lêem as estrelas, quando muito como astrólogos, não como astrônomos. Em sua maior parte, as pessoas aprenderam a ler para atenderem a alguma mesquinha conveniência, assim como aprenderam a fazer contas para manterem em dia sua contabilidade, sem serem enganadas em seus negócios; quanto a ler como um nobre exercício intelectual, trata-se de algo sobre o qual pouco ou nada sabem. No entanto, essa é a única forma possível de leitura no sentido mais elevado do termo; não aquela que nos acalenta corno um luxo, ao mesmo tempo que entorpece as nossas mais nobres aptidões, mas aquela em que temos que nos colocar na ponta dos pés para ler, dedicando-lhe as melhores horas da nossa vigília." Assim escreveu Thoreau em seu maravilhoso livro, Walden.

This changed in the twentieth century, when universal suffrage and the rise of socialist and social democratic parties democratized the composition of parliaments. From the 1920s to the 1950s, MPs without college degrees served in substantial numbers, accounting for one-third to one-half of legislators. Beginning in the 1960s, the portion of degree holders began to climb, and by the 2000s, non–college graduates were as rare in national legislatures as they were in the days of aristocrats and landed gentry. 52

But Macron’s popularity soon faded, and his government was confronted with a series of street protests by citizens who donned the yellow safety vests (gilets jaunes ) worn by stranded motorists. The protesters, mainly middle- and working-class residents of areas outside Paris, were angered by an increase in gas taxes, Macron’s aloof manner, and economic policies that did little for those left behind by globalization. When, in the midst of the crisis, a senior politician from Macron’s party was asked what mistakes by the government had provoked the protests, he replied, “We were probably too intelligent, too subtle.” 71

Today, 59 percent of Republicans believe that colleges and universities have a negative effect on the way things are going in the country, and only 33 percent view higher education favorably.

The rhetoric of rising, with its single-minded focus on education as the answer to inequality, is partly to blame. Building a politics around the idea that a college degree is a condition of dignified work and social esteem has a corrosive effect on democratic life. It devalues the contributions of those without a diploma, fuels prejudice against less-educated members of society, effectively excludes most working people from representative government, and provokes political backlash.

Today the eminent know that success is just reward for their own capacity, for their own efforts, and for their own undeniable achievement. They deserve to belong to a superior class. They know too, that not only are they of higher caliber to start with, but that a first-class education has been built upon their native gifts.

According to this complaint, meritocracy is a myth, a distant promise yet to be redeemed. 14

Second, that I live in a society that prizes the talents I happen to have is also not something for which I can claim credit. This too is a matter of good fortune. LeBron James makes tens of millions of dollars playing basketball, a hugely popular game. Beyond being blessed with prodigious athletic gifts, LeBron is lucky to live in a society that values and rewards them. It is not his doing that he lives today, when people love the game at which he excels, rather than in Renaissance Florence, when fresco painters, not basketball players, were in high demand.

O homem de espirito é o menos habil para escrever a uma mulher. Quando se arrisca a escrever uma carta, sente difficuldades incriveis. Desprezando o vasconço da galanteria, não sabe como se hade faze entender. Quer ser reservado e parece frio; quer dizer o que espera e indica receio; confessa que nada tem para agradar, e é apanhado pela palavra. Commette o crime de não ser commum ou vulgar. As suas cartas sahem do coração e não da cabeça; têem o estylo simples, claro e limpido, contendo apenas alguns detalhes tocantes. Mas é exactamente o que faz com que ellas não sejam lidas, nem comprehendidas. São cartas decentes, quando as pedem estupidas.

How to contend with them? Some defenders of meritocracy worry that the only alternative to equality of opportunity is equality of result, a kind of leveling equality that would handicap the gifted to prevent them from gaining a competitive edge. In a short story called “Harrison Bergeron,” the author Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., imagines a dystopian future in which those with superior intelligence, physical strength, and good looks are required to wear elaborate encumbrances and disguises to offset their natural advantages.

(People often get basic psychological questions backwards. Why do people take drugs? Not a mystery. It’s why they don’t take them all the time that’s the mystery. Why do people suffer from anxiety? That’s not a mystery. How is that people can ever be calm? There’s the mystery. We’re breakable and mortal. A million things can go wrong, in a million ways. We should be terrified out of our skulls at every second. But we’re not. The same can be said for depression, laziness and criminality.)

They disguised their resentment and jealousy with piety, sanctimony and self-righteousness. Things in the unconscious—or on the social justice–dispensing leftist front—haven’t changed much, today. It is because of of Freud, Jung, Nietzsche—and Orwell—that I always wonder, “What, then, do you stand against?” whenever I hear someone say, too loudly, “I stand for this!” The question seems particularly relevant if the same someone is complaining, criticizing, or trying to change someone else’s behaviour.

if you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences—and infer the motivation. This is a psychological scalpel. It’s not always a suitable instrument. It can cut too deeply, or in the wrong places. It is, perhaps, a last-resort option. Nonetheless, there are times when its application proves enlightening.

“So you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question. You’ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor. Why should it? The poor have been rebels, but they have never been anarchists: they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government. The poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man hasn’t; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always objected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always anarchists, as you can see from the barons’ wars.”

Now, I have some beliefs that might be regarded as left-leaning. I think, for example, that the tendency for valuable goods to distribute themselves with pronounced inequality constitutes an ever-present threat to the stability of society. I think there is good evidence for that. That does not mean that the solution to the problem is self-evident. We don’t know how to redistribute wealth without introducing a whole host of other problems.

Men enforce a code of behaviour on each other, when working together. Do your work. Pull your weight. Stay awake and pay attention. Don’t whine or be touchy. Stand up for your friends. Don’t suck up and don’t snitch. Don’t be a slave to stupid rules. Don’t, in the immortal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, be a girlie man. Don’t be dependent. At all. Ever. Period. The harassment that is part of acceptance on a working crew is a test: are you tough, entertaining, competent and reliable? If not, go away. Simple as that. We don’t need to feel sorry for you. We don’t want to put up with your narcissism, and we don’t want to do your work.

When the boys were spinning donuts, they were also testing the limits of their cars, their ability as drivers, and their capacity for control, in an out-of-control situation. When they told off the teachers, they were pushing against authority, to see if there was any real authority there—the kind that could be relied on, in principle, in a crisis. When they quit school, they went to work as rig roughnecks when it was forty bloody degrees below zero. It wasn’t weakness that propelled so many out of the classroom, where a better future arguably awaited. It was strength.

São, na verdade, duplas de amigos (um estranho conceito de amizade, no meu entendimento), que vão juntos para a academia numa espécie de duelo. Quem levanta mais peso no supino? Quem aguenta mais no adutor? E no abdutor? Um fiscaliza o outro e depois vai para o aparelho tentar superar o peso levantado. Comecei a entender a dinâmica, que confesso achar bem bizarra: não se trata de um incentivo mútuo, mas sim de uma competição genuína e cotidiana.

Tudo isso é de fazer perder a paciência a um anjo! Força! Num selvagem, num mongol também existe força. De que nos serve ela? É-nos cara a civilização. São-nos caros os seus frutos. Não me diga que os frutos da civilização nada valem. O último dos indecentes, um barbouilleur{3}, um escamoteador de jogo que recebe cinco moedas por noite são mais úteis do que os senhores, porque representam a civilização e não a força brutal dos mongóis! Pensam os senhores que são homens da vanguarda. Estariam bem numa cabana de selvagens! Força! Lembrem-se, afinal, senhores da força, de que são apenas quatro pessoas e meia, e contra os senhores existem milhões que não lhes permitirão calcar aos pés suas crenças sagradas. Esmagá-los-ão!

But what they are entitled to is not proportional to nor dependent upon their intrinsic worth.” The principles of justice that define people’s duties and rights “do not mention moral desert, and there is no tendency for distributive shares to correspond to it.” 50

It supports the disparaging view that welfare recipients have little to contribute and are incapable of acting responsibly. And as Anderson rightly observes, denying that those in need of public support can exercise meaningful choice is hard to reconcile with respecting them as equal citizens, capable of sharing in self-government. 64

From 1976 to 2012, the amount of time American parents devoted to helping their children with their homework increased more than fivefold. 65  As the college admission stakes grew, anxious, intrusive parenting became a common affliction. A 2009 Time magazine cover story sounded the alarm: “The Case Against Over-Parenting: Why It Is Time for Mom and Dad to Cut the Strings.” We had become “so obsessed with our kids’ success,” Time observed, “that parenting turned into a form of product development.” The drive to manage childhood now began early. “Among 6-to-8-year-olds, free playtime dropped 25% from 1981 to ’97, and homework more than doubled.” 66

What accounts for the inordinate levels of emotional distress among young people from affluent families? The answer has largely to do with the meritocratic imperative—the unrelenting pressure to perform, to achieve, to succeed. “For children and parents alike,” Luthar writes, “it is nearly impossible to ignore the ubiquitous, pervasive message emblazoned from their early years onward: there is one path to ultimate happiness—having money—that in turn comes from attending prestigious colleges.” 72

In seeking to dismantle the sorting machine that Conant set in motion, it is worth noticing that the regime of merit exerts its tyranny in two directions at once. Among those who land on top, it induces anxiety, a debilitating perfectionism, and a meritocratic hubris that struggles to conceal a fragile self-esteem. Among those it leaves behind, it imposes a demoralizing, even humiliating sense of failure.

Contrast the small amount being spent on employment and training with the amount spent on higher education in the form of grants, loans, and tax credits. For the academic year 2014–2015, a total of $162 billion was spent to help people go to college.

The American indifference to active labor market policies may reflect the market faith that supply and demand (in this case, for labor) automatically align, without outside help. But it also reflects the meritocratic conviction that higher education is the primary avenue to opportunity. “One reason the United States may have neglected employment and training,” Sawhill writes, “is because the emphasis has been on financing higher education. The assumption seems to be that everyone needs to go to college.” 102

As the cultural historian Christopher Lasch observed, foreign visitors to America in the nineteenth century were struck by its broad equality of condition. By this they meant neither an equal distribution of wealth nor even the opportunity to rise, but rather an independence of mind and judgment that put all citizens on a roughly equal footing:

Lasch makes the broader point that the egalitarian character of American society in the nineteenth century was less about social mobility than about the general diffusion of intelligence and learning across all classes and vocations. 106  This is the kind of equality that meritocratic sorting destroys. It seeks to concentrate intelligence and learning in the citadel of higher education and promises access to the citadel through a fair competition.

The overall death rate for white men and women in middle age (ages 45–54) has not changed much over the past two decades. But mortality varies greatly by education. Since the 1990s, death rates for college graduates declined by 40 percent. For those without a college degree, they rose by 25 percent. Here then is another advantage of the well-credentialed. If you have a bachelor’s degree, your risk of dying in middle age is only one quarter of the risk facing those without a college diploma. 14

What Kennedy glimpsed about the discontent of his time is what contemporary liberals miss about ours. They have been offering working-class and middle-class voters a greater measure of distributive justice—fairer, fuller access to the fruits of economic growth. But what these voters want even more is a greater measure of contributive justice—an opportunity to win the social recognition and esteem that goes with producing what others need and value.

The true value of our contribution cannot be measured by the wage we receive, for wages depend, as the economist-philosopher Frank Knight pointed out (see chapter 5 ), on contingencies of supply and demand. The value of our contribution depends instead on the moral and civic importance of the ends our efforts serve. This involves an independent moral judgment that the labor market, however efficient, cannot provide.

Over the past four decades, market-driven globalization and the meritocratic conception of success, taken together, have unraveled these moral ties. Global supply chains, capital flows, and the cosmopolitan identities they fostered made us less reliant on our fellow citizens, less grateful for the work they do, and less open to the claims of solidarity. Meritocratic sorting taught us that our success is our own doing, and so eroded our sense of indebtedness. We are now in the midst of the angry whirlwind this unraveling has produced. To renew the dignity of work, we must repair the social bonds the age of merit has undone.

It is often assumed that the only alternative to equality of opportunity is a sterile, oppressive equality of results. But there is another alternative: a broad equality of condition that enables those who do not achieve great wealth or prestigious positions to live lives of decency and dignity—developing and exercising their abilities in work that wins social esteem, sharing in a widely diffused culture of learning, and deliberating with their fellow citizens about public affairs.

The answer to this question depends on recognizing that, for all our striving, we are not self-made and self-sufficient; finding ourselves in a society that prizes our talents is our good fortune, not our due.

Myth, and the drama that is part of myth, provide answers in image to the following question: “how can the current state of experience be conceptualized in abstraction, with regards to its meaning?” [which means its (subjective, biologically predicated, socially constructed) emotional relevance or motivational significance]. Meaning means implication for behavioral output; logically, therefore, myth presents information relevant to the most fundamental of moral problems: “what should be? (what should be done?)”

The question of “what should be?” (what line should be traveled?) therefore has contained within it, so to speak, three subqueries, which might be formulated as follows: 1) What is? What is the nature (meaning, the significance) of the current state of experience? 2) What should be? To what (desirable, valuable) end should that state be moving? 3) How should we therefore act? What is the nature of the specific processes by which the present state might be transformed into that which is desired?

We all produce models of what is and what should be, and how to transform one into the other. We change our behavior, when the consequences ofthat behavior are not what we would like. But sometimes mere alteration in behavior is insufficient. We must change not only what we do, but what we think is important.

The central notion of the way underlies manifestation of four more specific myths, or classes of myths, and provides a more complete answer, in dramatic form, to the three questions posed previously [what is the nature (meaning, the significance) of current being?, to what (desirable) end should that state be moving? and, finally, what are the processes by which the present state might be transformed into that which is desired?] The four classes include: (1) myths describing a current or pre-existent stable state (sometimes a paradise, sometimes a tyranny); (2) myths describing the emergence of something anomalous, unexpected, threatening and promising into this initial state; (3) myths describing the dissolution of the pre-existent stable state into chaos, as a consequence of the anomalous or unexpected occurrence; (4) myths describing the regeneration of stability [paradise regained (or, tyranny regenerated)], from the chaotic mixture of dissolute previous experience and anomalous information.

The traditional Christian (and not just Christian) notion that man has fallen from an original “state of grace” into his current morally degenerate and emotionally unbearable condition—accompanied by a desire for the “return to Paradise”—constitutes a single example of this “metamyth.”

The manner in which we act as children, for example, may be perfectly appropriate for the conditions of childhood; the processes of maturation change the conditions of existence, introducing anomaly where only certainty once stood, making necessary not only a change of plans, but reconceptualization of where those plans might lead, and what or who they refer to, in the present.

In this sense a distinct set of changes in the nervous system is isomorphic with the external agent that it reflects and resembles.

But we won't work for food, at least not very hard, if we have enough food; we won't work for sex, if we are satisfied with our present levels of sexual activity; and we might be very pleased to go hungry, if that means our enemy will starve. Our predictions, expectations and desires condition our evaluations to a finally unspecifiable degree. Things have no absolutely fixed significance, despite our ability to generalize about their value. It is our personal preferences, therefore, that determine the import of the world (but these preferences have constraints!).

Our situations—and, therefore, our “contexts of interpretation”—can change dramatically, at any moment. We are indeed fortunate (and, generally, oblivious ofthat fortune) when they do not.

This is tantamount to saying, “you must know everything that has ever happened to that animal”; analogous to the old determinist claim that “if you knew the present position and momentum of every particle in the universe, you could determine all future positions and momenta.” You can't know all present positions and momenta: the measurement problems are insurmountable, and the uncertainty principle makes it impossible anyway.

Punishments—a diverse group of stimuli or contexts, as defined immediately below—all appear to share one feature (at least from the perspective of the theory outlined in this manuscript): they indicate the temporary or final impossibility of implementing one or more means or attaining one or more ends.

This does not mean, however, that our behaviors are determined—at least not in any simplistic manner. The subsystems that make up our shared structure— responsible, when operative, for our instincts (thirst, hunger, joy, lust, anger, etc.)—do not appear to directly grip control of our behavior, do not transform us into driven automatons. Rather, they appear to influence our fantasies, our plans, and alter and modify the content and comparative importance of our goals, our ideal futures (conceived of in comparison to our “unbearable” presents, as they are currently construed).

There is no reason to presume, after all, that each of our particularly specialized subsystems will agree, at any one time, about what constitutes the most immediately desirable “good.” This lack of easy agreement makes us intrinsically prone to intrapsychic conflict and associated affective (emotional) dysregulation.

Every part of us, kingdom that we are, depends on the healthy operation of every other part. To ignore one good, therefore, is to risk all. To ignore the demands of one necessary subsystem is merely to ensure that it will speak later with the voice of the unjustly oppressed; is to ensure that it will grip our fantasy, unexpectedly, and make of the future something unpredictable. Our “optimal paths” therefore, must be properly inclusive, from the perspective of our internal community, our basic physiology.

This interest and meaning signifies the presence of new information and constitutes a prepotent stimulus for human (and animal) action.89 It is where the unpredictable emerges that the possibility for all new and useful information exists. It is during the process of exploration of the unpredictable or unexpected that all knowledge and wisdom is generated, all boundaries of adaptive competence extended, all foreign territory explored, mapped and mastered.

(It is also of great interest to note that an additional waveform, the N4, is produced when human experimental subjects are exposed to abstracted symbols with integral significance, such as written, spoken or signed words and faces, in a meaningful context.102 In such a context, the N4 occurs after the N2 but before the P3, and increases in magnitude as a function of the difficulty of integrating the word with the context in which it appears. The amygdala and hippocampus are also directly responsible for the production of this waveform—and, therefore, for contextual synthesis, which is a vital aspect of the derivation of meaning, which is significance for behavior, given the desire to attain a particular goal.)

Se seguirmos a matriz da sabedoria israelita (“Provérbios”, “Eclesiastes”, “Livro de Jó”, “Cântico dos cânticos”), a espiritualidade monástica é muito próxima dessa matriz na medida em que valoriza a tradição (“Provérbios”), reconhece o pó que somos (“Eclesiastes”), combate a vaidade moral do bem (“Livro de Jó”) e busca o encontro direto com Deus, que se manifesta em felicidade no cotidiano (“Cântico dos cânticos”).

Por isso, ninguém pode ter certeza de que tem a graça. E quem se indaga se tem a graça é porque já está atolado no orgulho, pecado capital de Adão e Eva.

The neutral stimulus might be a light; the unconditioned stimulus, an electric shock. The light goes on; the floor of the rat's cage is briefly electrified. This sequence occurs repeatedly. Soon the rat “freezes” as soon as the light appears. He has developed a “conditioned response,” manifesting behavioral inhibition (and fear, theoretically) to something that was previously neutral. Procedures of this sort effectively produce fear.

The animal builds its world of significances from the information generated in the course of—as a consequence of—ongoing exploratory behavior. The application of experimental search programs, drawn primarily from the reservoir of learned (imitated) and instinctual behavior, or manifested as trial and error, involves behavioral alteration (exploration, play) and subsequent transformation of sensory and affective input.

Processing of novel or otherwise interesting sensory information, associated with the orienting complex, heightened awareness and focused concentration, activates large areas of neocortex. Similarly, increased cortical mobilization takes place during the practice phase of skill acquisition, when awareness appears required for development of control. The area of such engagement or mobilization shrinks in size as movement becomes habitual and unconscious, or when sensory information loses interest or novelty.

To put it most fundamentally: it appears that the twin hemispheres of the brain are differentially specialized (1) for operation in unexplored territory, where the nature and valence of things remains indeterminate, and (2) for operation in explored territory, where things have been rendered either irrelevant or positive, as a consequence of previous exploration. Our brains contain two emotional systems, so to speak. One functions when we do not know what to do, and initiates the (exploratory) process that creates secure territory. The other functions when we are in fact secure. The fact of the presence of these two subsystems, but not their “locale,” has been

Patterns of behavioral adaptation and schemas of classification or representation can be derived from the observation of others (and, for that matter, from the observation of one-self). How we act in the presence of things, in their constantly shifting and generally social context, is what those things mean (or even what they are), before what they mean (or what they are) can be more abstractly (or “objectively”) categorized. What a thing is, therefore, might be determined (in the absence of more useful information) by examination of how action is conducted in its presence, which is to say that if someone runs from something it is safe to presume that the thing is dangerous (the action in fact defines that presumption).

We live in social groups; most of our interactions are social in nature. We spend most of our time around others and, when we are alone, we still wish to understand, predict and control our personal behaviors. Our maps of the “understood part of the world” are therefore in large part maps of patterns of actions—of behaviors established as a consequence of creative exploration, and modified in the course of endless social interactions.

If one emphasizes that reason is a faculty of the individual, then individualism becomes a key theme in ethics. Locke’s A Letter concerning Toleration (1689) and Two Treatises of Government (1690) are landmark texts in the modern history of individualism. Both link the human capacity for reason to ethical individualism and its social consequences: the prohibition of force against another’s independent judgment or action, individual rights, political equality, limiting the power of government, and religious toleration.

Modern philosophy matured in the 1700s until the dominant set of views of the era were naturalism, reason and science, tabula rasa, individualism, and liberalism. The Enlightenment was both the dominance of those ideas in intellectual circles and their translation into practice. As a result, individuals were becoming freer, wealthier, living longer, and enjoying more material comfort than at any point before in history.

Postmodernism’s essentials are the opposite of modernism’s. Instead of natural reality—anti-realism. Instead of experience and reason—linguistic social subjectivism. Instead of individual identity and autonomy—various race, sex, and class group-isms. Instead of human interests as fundamentally harmonious and tending toward mutually-beneficial interaction—conflict and oppression. Instead of valuing individualism in values, markets, and politics—calls for communalism, solidarity, and egalitarian restraints. Instead of prizing the achievements of science and technology—suspicion tending toward outright hostility.

Modern debates were over truth and reality, reason and experience, liberty and equality, justice and peace, beauty and progress. In the postmodern framework, those concepts always appear in quotation marks. Our most strident voices tell us that “Truth” is a myth. “Reason” is a white male Eurocentric construct. “Equality” is a mask for oppressions. “Peace” and “Progress” are met with cynical and weary reminders of power—or explicit ad hominem attacks.

Why is it, for example, that skeptical and relativistic arguments have the cultural power that they now do? Why do they have that power in the humanities but not in the sciences? Why have themes of exhaustion, nihilism, and cynicism come to have the cultural dominance they do? And how can those intellectual themes coexist with a broader culture that is richer, freer, and more vigorous than any culture at any other point in history? Why is it that the leading postmodern thinkers are Left in their politics—in most cases, far Left? And why is it that that prominent segment of the Left—the same Left that traditionally defended its positions on the modernist grounds of reason, science, fairness for all, and optimism—is now voicing themes of anti-reason, anti-science, all’s-fair-in-love-and-war, and cynicism?

But what happens, worried the early Counter-Enlightenment thinkers, to traditional values of community and sacrifice, of duty and connectedness, if individuals are encouraged to calculate rationally their own gain? Will not such rational individualism encourage cold-blooded, short-range, and grasping selfishness? Will it not encourage individuals to reject long-standing traditions and to sever communal ties, thus creating a non-society of isolated, rootless and restless atoms?

What these two analyses of concepts had in common is the following hard choice. If we think of concepts as telling us something universal and necessary, then we have to think of them as having nothing to do with the world of sense experience; and if we think of concepts as having something to do with the world of sense experience, then we have to abandon the idea of knowing any real universal and necessary truths. In other words, experience and necessity have nothing to do with each other. This premise too was critical for Kant’s analysis.

The rationalists and the empiricists had jointly struck a blow to the Enlightenment confidence in reason. Reason works with concepts. But now we were to accept either that reason’s concepts have little to do with the world of sense experience—in which case, science’s conception of itself as generating universal and necessary truths about the world of sense-experience was in big trouble—or we were to accept that reason’s concepts are merely provisional and contingent groupings of sense-experiences—in which case science’s conception of itself as generating universal and necessary truths about the world of sense-experience was in big trouble.

But the conclusion of those skeptical arguments would be merely that we cannot be sure that we are right about the way reality is. We might be, but we cannot guarantee it, the skeptics would conclude. Kant’s point was deeper, arguing that in principle any conclusion reached by any of our faculties must necessarily not be about reality. Any form of cognition, because it must operate a certain way, cannot put us in contact with reality.

And, Kant also taught us, it can know only its own phenomenal creations.

As one episode ended, the Netflix player automatically loaded the next one, which began playing five seconds later. If the previous episode left you with a cliffhanger, all you had to do was sit still as the next episode began and the cliffhanger resolved itself.

O indivíduo não vive sozinho, e todos os atos por ele cometidos não afetam apenas ele mesmo, mas todos os que estão relacionados a tais atos, diretos ou indiretamente. Assim a ética está presente na vida humana e em qualquer sociedade, sendo necessário que haja normas, regras e valores em seu interior.

O tempo em que uma pessoa vive dá-lhe a oportunidade de se conhecer como um ser moral, engajado na busca da verdade: no entanto, esse dom que o homem tem nas mãos é ao mesmo tempo delicioso e amargo. E a vida não é mais que a fração de tempo que lhe foi concedida, durante a qual ele pode (e, na verdade, deve) moldar seu espírito de acordo com seu próprio entendimento dos objetivos da existência humana. No entanto, a rígida estrutura na qual ela se insere torna nossa responsabilidade para conosco e para com os outros ainda mais flagrantemente óbvia. A consciência humana depende do tempo para existir.

Em seu relato sobre o Japão, o jornalista soviético Ov-chinnikov escreveu: "Considera-se que o tempo, per se, ajuda a tornar conhecida a essência das coisas. Os japoneses, portanto, têm um fascínio especial por todos os sinais de velhi-ce. Sentem-se atraídos pelo tom escurecido de uma velha árvore, pela aspereza de uma rocha ou até mesmo pelo aspecto sujo de uma figura cujas extremidades foram manu-seadas por um grande número de pessoas. A todos esses sinais de uma idade avançada eles dão o nome de saba, que significa, literalmente, 'corrosão'. Saba, então, é um desgaste 66 natural da matéria, o fascínio da antigüidade, a marca do tempo, ou patina. Sabá. como elemento do belo, corporifica a ligação entre arte e natureza.''

The precosmogonic chaos tends to take metaphorical form as the uroboros, the self-consuming serpent who represents the union of matter and spirit, and the possibility of transformation. The uroboros serves as “primal source” of the mythological world parents (the Great Mother, nature, deity of the unknown, creative and destructive; the Great Father, culture, deity of the familiar, tyrannical and protective) and of their “Divine Son” (the Knower, the generative Word, the process of exploration).

Sei que tudo isso é bobagem. O novo moralismo, filho da esquerda festiva, diz que, se você gosta de apanhar, é porque você é uma mulher machista. Antes a acusariam de pecadora, agora de reprimida e machista. A festiva virou o puritanismo secular de hoje. O feminismo é a nova forma de repressão da sexualidade feminina, e logo será de toda forma de sexualidade.

E o fará melhor toda vez que, integrando-se ao espírito delas, se aproprie de seus temas fundamentais, reconheça suas tarefas concretas. Uma das grandes, se não a maior, tragédia do homem moderno está em que é hoje dominado pela força dos mitos e comandado pela publicidade organizada, ideológica ou não, e por isso vem renunciando cada vez, sem o saber, à sua capacidade de decidir. Vem sendo expulso da órbita das decisões. As tarefas de seu tempo não são captadas pelo homem simples, mas a ele apresentadas por uma “elite” que as interpreta e lhes entrega em forma de receita, de prescrição a ser seguida. E, quando julga que se salva seguindo as prescrições, afoga-se no anonimato nivelador da massificação, sem esperança e sem fé, domesticado e acomodado: já não é sujeito. Rebaixa-se a puro objeto.

Primeiro, porque uma vez escravizado o indivíduo nem sempre dispunha de tempo e condições para ser educado de acordo com as leis islâmicas, e segundo, porque o trabalhador escravo era fundamental para a viabilidade do comércio dos mercadores muçulmanos.

Na África, a vigilância da marinha britânica provocou mu-danças significativas na forma como as operações comerciais eram realizadas. A mais visível foi o abandono das fortalezas que servi-ram durante séculos como entrepostos comerciais e portos de embarque utilizados por traficantes europeus e brasileiros. Na região do Golfo de Benim, o embarque de escravos passou a ser feito em pequenos portos espalhados pelo litoral. Para fugir à per-seguição da marinha inglesa, os traficantes passaram a utilizar embarcações menores, mais rápidas e com capacidade de transportar em torno de cem pessoas.

A abolição do tráfico teve várias conseqüências. Desde então não havia como renovar a população escrava. Logicamente, o número de africanos tendeu a diminuir enquanto o número de crioulos (negros nascidos no Brasil) tendeu a crescer na população cativa. O preço dos cativos aumentou rapidamente depois de 1850 e isso teve como conseqüência a concentração dos escravos em mãos de um número cada vez mais reduzido de proprietários.

Our own research has shown that the spread of influence in social networks obeys what we call the Three Degrees of Influence Rule. Everything we do or say tends to ripple through our network, having an impact on our friends (one degree), our friends’ friends (two degrees), and even our friends’ friends’ friends (three degrees). Our influence gradually dissipates and ceases to have a noticeable effect on people beyond the social frontier that lies at three degrees of separation.

One way to think about this socially is that there is decay in the fidelity of information as it is transmitted, as in the child’s game of telephone. So, if you quit smoking or endorse a particular political candidate, by the time this information reaches your friends’ friends’ friends’ friend, that person may no longer have accurate or reliable information about what you actually did.

While this inherent limit may seem, well, limiting (who doesn’t want to rule the world?) , we should remember how small the world is. If we are connected to everyone else by six degrees and we can influence them up to three degrees, then one way to think about ourselves is that each of us can reach about halfway to everyone else on the planet.

This is why naïve realism"Kant, Immanuel: on naïve has been an impossible project. The knowing subject is not a blank, identity-less tablet, so it cannot be that the object alone makes knowledge possible. Given its finite identity, the knowing subject is implicated in producing its experiences, and from the limited and conditioned experiences that are produced the subject cannot read off what is really real.

Psychologists have identified the way that feelings of loneliness fit in with a broad set of other feelings and states, including self-esteem, anxiety, anger, sadness, optimism, and shyness. Psychological research suggests that feelings of loneliness occur when there is a discrepancy between our desire for connection to others and the actual connections we have.

These two mechanisms—behavioral imitation and norms—can be found in some of the examples we gave in the previous chapter for how marriage affects health. But it can be difficult to tell them apart. When a man gives up his motorcycle after getting hitched, is he copying his wife’s behavior (she doesn’t have a motorcycle) or adopting a new norm (the infernal things are unsafe)? Moreover, having accepted the idea that weight gain is normative, a person might go on to exhibit either the same or entirely different weight-gain behaviors from those around him. People around you might eat poorly and consequently gain weight, but you might wind up exercising less rather than copying the bad eating habits. While the norm that spreads is the same in this scenario (weight gain is OK), the behavior is not.

For Kierkegaard, the core lesson from Kant was that one must not try to relate to reality cognitively—what is needed is action, commitment, a leap into that which one cannot know but which one feels is essential to give meaning to one’s life. In accordance with Kierkegaard’s felt religious needs, what is needed is an irrational leap of faith.

If we then ask what our core feelings are, we connect with the answers from the past century’s dominant theories of human nature.  From Kierkegaard and Heidegger, we learn that our emotional core is a deep sense of dread and guilt. From Marx, we feel a deep sense of alienation, victimization, and rage. From Nietzsche, we discover a deep need for power. From Freud, we uncover the urgings of dark and aggressive sexuality. Rage, power, guilt, lust, and dread constitute the center of the postmodern emotional universe.

Part of that something else is that postmodernists have taken to heart Fredric Jameson’s remark that “everything is ‘in the last analysis’ political.”[117] The spirit of Jameson’s remark lies behind the persistent postmodernist charge that epistemology is merely a tool of power, that all claims of objectivity and rationality mask oppressive political agendas. It stands to reason, then, that postmodern appeals to subjectivity and irrationality can also be in the service of political ends. But why?

Postmodernism is the academic far Left’s epistemological strategy for responding to the crisis caused by the failures of socialism in theory and in practice.

That is my second hypothesis: Postmodernism is a response to the crisis of faith of the academic far Left. Its epistemology justifies the leap of faith necessary to continue believing in socialism, and that same epistemology justifies using language not as a vehicle for seeking truth but as a rhetorical weapon in the continuing battle against capitalism.

“Reason is what engenders egocentrism,” wrote Rousseau, and reflection strengthens it. Reason is what turns man in upon himself. Reason is what separates him from all that troubles him and afflicts him. Philosophy is what isolates him and what moves him to say in secret, at the sight of a suffering man, ‘Perish if you will; I am safe and sound.’[132]

Real education must start by getting to the source of human nature. Education must exert “an influence penetrating to the roots of vital impulse and action.” Here was a great failing of traditional education, for it had relied upon and appealed to the student’s free will. “I should reply that that very recognition of, and reliance upon, free will in the pupil is the first mistake of the old system.” Compulsion, not freedom, is best for students:

[T]he legislation should consequently maintain a high standard of severity, and should prohibit the doing of many things. Such prohibitions, which simply must exist and on which the existence of the community depends, are to be enforced in case of necessity by fear of immediate punishment, and this penal law must be administered absolutely without indulgence or exception.[195]

Given that the individual’s ultimate purpose in life should be to achieve union with ultimate reality, it follows that the “state in and by itself is the ethical whole, the actualization of freedom.”

Yet it is also true, Hegel granted, that in many cases the individual’s freedoms and interests will genuinely be set aside, overridden, and even smashed. One reason for this is that the state’s general principles are universal and necessary, and so they cannot be expected to apply perfectly to the particular and contingent. As Hegel explained, “universal law is not designed for the units of the mass. These as such may, in fact, find their interests decidedly thrust into the background.”

We find in the case of Kant a call for individuals to be willing to do their duty to sacrifice for the species; we find in the case of Herder a call for individuals to find their identity in their ethnicity; we find in the case of Fichte a call for education to be process of total socialization; and we find in the case of Hegel a call for total government to which the individual will surrender everything. For a school of thinkers who advocated total socialization, “socialism” seemed an appropriate label. Accordingly, many thinkers on the collectivist Right thought of themselves as true socialists.

By some strange co-incidence, Buckley was in New York’s Electric Lady Studios, just as Smith and Kaye had commenced work on Gone Again, her first album in eight years. When they needed a vocal part for the song ‘Southern Cross’, they turned to Buckley, whose voice was a perfect match. He also contributed an Eastern-influenced instrumental passage to another track, ‘Fireflies’.

Iain ‘Emo’ Moore é lembrado por outro de seus contemporâneos como “um cara careteiro, gesticulador e maluco, com a maioria dos dentes faltando”. Como seu amigo, Pip, Emo se tornaria um confidente próximo de Syd Barrett e David Gilmour. Nos anos 1970 e começo dos 1980, trabalhou como porteiro para Gilmour e sua mulher Ginger. Ator ocasional, chegou a aparecer em diversos videoclipes e teve uma aparição “piscou, perdeu” no filme do Pink Floyd, The Wall, fazendo o papel de padrinho do personagem interpretado por Bob Geldof.

Após uma hora escutando sua obra, você saía para as ruas e permanecia com a sensação de continuar a ouvi-la. Havia um filme completamente improvisado chamado Shadows, feito por John Cassavetes no final dos anos 1950, e o AMM era o equivalente musical daquilo. Absolutamente hipnótico.”

Na plateia também estava a inexperiente escritora Jenny Fabian, que em 1969 publicaria o seu laureado romance musical Groupie. “Eu tinha acabado de largar meu primeiro marido e estava vivendo em Powis Square”, ela afirma. “Sempre na expectativa de algo extraordinário, fui atraída até o All Saints Hall por causa das pessoas que via entrando. A música era interessante e o vocalista parecia incrível.” Jenner e King “eram como dois escoteiros que conheci em uma vida passada”, disse Jenny. Ela “permitiu que Andrew a seduzisse”, antes de se aproximar do verdadeiro objeto de seu desejo, Barrett, que depois apareceria em seu romance sob o disfarce de Ben, enquanto a banda era rebatizada de Satin Odyssey.

Waters havia feito sua estreia como compositor com a ainda não gravada “Walk With Me, Sydney”, um dueto sentimental que deveria ser gravado por Barrett e Juliette Gale. Em novembro de 1966, o repertório da banda incluiria composições de Barrett como “Matilda Mother” e “Astronomy Domine”, assim como o primeiro esforço de Waters, “Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk”. “Todos eram encorajados a escrever”, diz Jenner, “mas foi Syd quem trouxe as melhores canções”.

Vic Singh, contratado para fotografar a banda para a capa do álbum, partilhava dessa mesma incerteza. “A música que eles faziam parecia alienígena e muito surreal”, ele diz. “Quando a escutei pela primeira vez, pensei: ‘Isso jamais vai funcionar’.” Na época dividindo o estúdio com, entre outros, David Bailey, Singh era um fotógrafo promissor e amigo de George Harrison. “George tinha ganhado lentes de prisma. Ele não sabia o que fazer com aquilo, então deu para mim.” Singh disse a Jenner e King para buscarem em todas as lojas possíveis as roupas mais brilhantes que encontrassem para vestir a banda. Dessa vez, até mesmo Syd parecia feliz de seguir as regras. Vic relaxou a banda “com alguns baseados e uns copos de uísque com café, e então mandou ver”. As lentes do mais quieto dos Beatles repartiu a imagem final, duplicando o Floyd. “Era pouco usual e diferente, e eles adoraram”, diz Singh. “E Syd fez um pequeno desenho na contracapa.” The Piper at the Gates of Dawn seria um dos poucos álbuns do Pink Floyd a, de fato, mostrar o grupo na capa.

Barbet Schroeder, filho de um diplomata suíço, era um cineasta de segunda linha que começara sua carreira como assistente do diretor Jean-Luc Godard. O roteiro de More era centrado nas desventuras de um caronista que sucumbe ao vício da heroína após encontrar uma bela junkie. Com cenas que mostravam consumo de drogas, um bongô selvagem sendo tocado e os seios nus de sua estrela loira, Mimsi Farmer, é um filme que talvez só pudesse ser feito na década de 1960.

Apesar de sua letra sombria, o riff de “Free Four” foi perfeito para as rádios americanas de FM. O Floyd ainda se recusava estoicamente a lançar singles no Reino Unido, mas abriu uma exceção para os Estados Unidos. “Free Four” obteve sucesso suficiente por lá para se tornar um pequeno hit. Obscured by Clouds teve lançamento mundial em junho de 1972 e chegou ao número 46 nos Estados Unidos, tornando-se o primeiro disco do Pink Floyd a entrar para o Top 50 americano.

Peter Watts tinha sido o mais antigo membro da equipe do Floyd, tendo se juntado à banda seis meses antes de David Gilmour. Infelizmente, seu uso de drogas o tornara um risco. Watts era repetidamente demitido por delitos como usar Mandrax enquanto dirigia o carro da banda, mas sempre era recontratado. O grupo pagou um curso de reabilitação para ele, mas sem efeitos duradouros. Watts foi despedido em 1974 e morreu em agosto de 1976, no apartamento de Gilmour, na McGregor Road. Sua filha, Naomi, se tornaria uma modelo e atriz famosa.

At the same time (and here Adorno has a point) this cultural context is unlike anything that has been documented in the work of anthropologists. Popular culture is not a system of moral or religious norms, does not find expression in customs and ceremonies, is not induced through rites of passage and is often enjoyed in solitude and without any essential reference to a community of initiates.

Com o álbum completo, apesar dos esforços de ambas as equipes jurídicas (“os únicos que realmente ganharam com aquilo”, como pontuaria Mason depois), a banda se viu agora enrolada pela busca de um título. Ciente de que qualquer título poderia ser desconstruído para se relacionar com a atual situação da banda ou abrir o precedente para zombarias de Waters, eles rejeitaram três possibilidades – Signs of Life, Of Promises Broken e Delusions of Maturity – em favor de A Momentary Lapse of Reason, uma frase saída da letra de “One Slip”. No final, Waters ainda tiraria sarro (“decerto um lapso de razão”).

Ezrin não era a única figura de peso que estava na lista de Waters. Enquanto gravava o álbum, ele abordou o cineasta Stanley Kubrick para pedir permissão de usar no álbum diálogos do filme 2001: Uma Odisseia no Espaço. Kubrick recusou e acabou mencionado em uma mensagem ilegível gravada de trás para a frente no começo da música “Perfect Sense Part 1”. Quem sabe, Kubrick talvez apenas estivesse devolvendo a Waters sua recusa em permitir que ele usasse Atom Heart Mother em um de seus filmes, mais de vinte anos antes.

Em novembro, a família de Syd Barrett vendeu suas posses por meio da casa de leilões Cheffins, em Cambridge. O número 6 da St. Margaret’s Square também foi colocado à venda. Entre as idiossincráticas mobílias, havia estranhas maçanetas customizadas, esquemas de cores excêntricos e as bicicletas de Syd pintadas a mão. A observação de Paul Weller sobre um homem aprisionado em um curto espaço de tempo parecia mais pungente quando se observava o lugar. Aquela era a casa de Roger Barrett, não “Syd”. Esse homem tinha vivido de forma frugal e, como transpareceu depois, abaixo de seus meios, cercado por livros, suas próprias escritas, incluindo uma história de arte não concluída e um pacote de CDs. Nada de rock, apenas jazz como Miles Davis e Charlie Parker. Sua abordagem distraída do “faça você mesmo” – uma mesa de café com um compartimento caseiro preso embaixo – parecia ser a prova de seu estado mental confuso. Havia outro lado ermo em sua vida.

"Liberalism,” wrote Moeller, “is the Death of Nations.”[234] So socialism had to be able to prevail against it. Yet it had to be the correct kind of socialism—and the correct kind of socialism was not Marxist. Marxist internationalism, the Right thinkers from Spengler to Sombart to Moeller argued, ended up being a false or illusory version of socialism. There is no universal culture, so there is no universal set of interests and no universal form that socialism can take. Socialism must be national—it must be rooted in each culture’s distinctive historical context. “Every people has its own socialism,” wrote Moeller, and so “international socialism does not exist.”[235]

The Social Democrats were willing to compromise with other parties and share power with them; only endless bickering and vacillation could result from that, which would serve only to maintain the capitalist status quo. The National Socialists, of course, were on the political Right, so by definition they had to be in the pockets of the capitalists.

Thus Goebbels had often been more than willing to make speeches and write conciliatory essays to the Communists, asking them to recognize that the National Socialists’ and Communists’ major goals of overthrowing capitalism and achieving socialism were the same—and that the only significant difference between the two was that the Communists believed that socialism could be achieved at the international level, while the National Socialists believed that it could and should occur at the national level.[241]

First formulated in the mid-nineteenth century, classical Marxist socialism made two related pairs of claims, one pair economic and one pair moral. Economically, it argued that capitalism was driven by a logic of competitive exploitation that would cause its eventual collapse; socialism’s communal form of production, by contrast, would prove to be economically superior. Morally, it argued, capitalism was evil both because of the self-interested motives of those engaged in capitalist competition and because of the exploitation and alienation that competition caused; socialism, by contrast, would be based on selfless sacrifice and communal sharing.

Mao de-emphasized technology and rationality: Chinese socialism would be more agrarian and low-tech, and it would be brought about less by logic and reason than by sheer, unpredictable will and assertion.

The lesson that the leftest of the Left radicals drew was: So much for democracy. So much for the grass-roots, bottom-up approach, and so much for appealing to the masses and waiting for them to do anything. What socialism needs is leadership, leadership that will diagnose capitalism’s problems clearly, set remedies, and act decisively and ruthlessly to achieve socialism—along the way telling the masses what they need to hear and what to do and when.

economic data were mixed and the propaganda was heavy, the Soviet Union was experiencing chronic difficulties in providing basic consumer items and feeding its people. Some productive successes had been achieved by directing vast amounts of resources to the military and heavy industries. Yet in providing for its people’s basic needs, the Soviet Union was not only not progressing—in many areas its production had declined to levels below those of the pre-1917, pre-communist-revolution era. In the 1950s, contemporary data from both Soviet and American sources painted much the same picture:[256]

Socialists have generally been willing to grant that possibly, just possibly, capitalist economic production would outstrip socialist production. But no socialist has ever been willing to grant that capitalism can hold a candle to socialism morally.[257] Socialism is driven more than anything else by an ethic of altruism, by a conviction that morality is about selflessness, being willing to put others’ needs before one’s own, and, when necessary, being willing to sacrifice oneself for others, especially those others who are weaker and needier. Thus, to a socialist, any socialist nation has to be morally superior to any capitalist nation—socialist leaders are by definition concerned primarily about the needs of the citizens and are sensitively responsive to their expressions of concern, their grievances, and, when there are troubles, to their plights.

What was once a monolithic Marxist Left proceeded to split into numerous camps. All of the camps recognized, though, that if the fight against capitalism were to be carried on, the first order of business was to distance socialism from the Soviet Union. Just as the disaster of National Socialism in Germany was not socialism, the disaster of Communism in the Soviet Union was not socialism. In fact, there were no real socialist societies anywhere, so pointing fingers of moral condemnation was simply meaningless.

Yet come the 1950s it was hard to argue that capitalism fails to satisfy its people’s needs. In fact, a big part of the problem seemed to be that capitalism had satisfied its people’s needs so well that the people had become fat and complacent and not at all revolutionary. So a moral standard that made satisfying needs primary was now useless in a critique of capitalism.

A new ethical standard was therefore necessary. With great fanfare, then, much of the Left changed its official ethical standard from need to equality. No longer was the primary criticism of capitalism to be that it failed to satisfy people’s needs. The primary criticism was to be that its people did not get an equal share.

Following Marx, Marcuse believed that the historical purpose of the proletariat was to be a revolutionary class. Its task was to overthrow capitalism. But that presupposed that capitalism would drive the proletariat into economic misery, which capitalism had failed to do. Instead, capitalism had produced great amounts of wealth and—here is the innovation—capitalism had used that wealth to oppress the proletariat. By making the members of the proletariat wealthy enough to become comfortable, capitalism had created a captive class: The proletariat had become locked into the capitalist system, dependent upon its goodies, and enslaved by the goal of climbing the economic ladder and to “the aggressive performances of ‘earning a living’.”[266] Not only was this a veiled form of oppression, Marcuse argued, the proletariat had become distracted from its historical

If one is an academic foe of capitalism, then one’s weapons and tactics are not those of the politician, the activist, the revolutionary, or the terrorist. Academics’ only possible weapons are words. And if one’s epistemology tells one that words are not about truth or reality or in any way cognitive, then in the battle against capitalism words can be only a rhetorical weapon.

The failure of Left politics to achieve that vision was merely the last straw.

Second: she said the killers were tripping on LSD the night of the Tate murders. If that were true, the defense could’ve argued that they had “diminished capacity,” thus sparing them the gas chamber. Bugliosi, wanting to eliminate that possibility, made Linda Kasabian testify on multiple occasions that no one took any drugs on the nights of the murders. (In a 2009 documentary, Kasabian contradicted her testimony, saying that all the killers had taken speed on the night of the Tate murders.)

What have survived are the many issues of the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs, the HAFMC’s in-house research organ, still active to this day. David Smith founded it in ’67, and at various points both he and Roger served on its editorial board. In the late sixties and early seventies, the journal printed a raft of articles by David and other clinicians about the long-term effects of LSD and amphetamines. One of these articles hoped to find out “whether a dramatic drug-induced experience” would have “a lasting impact on the individual’s personality.”

David Smith had studied these same phenomena, formulating an idea that he called “the psychedelic syndrome,” first articulated in 1967 or early ’68. The gist was that acid, when taken by groups of like-minded people, led to a “chronic LSD state” that reinforced “the interpretation of psychedelic reality.” The more often the same group of “friends” dropped acid, the more they encouraged one another to adopt the worldview they’d discovered together on LSD, thus producing “dramatic psychological changes.”

I couldn’t wrap my head around this. Why did Bugliosi ignore the most powerful prosecution evidence available: eyewitness testimony of Manson’s control from his parole officer, a laureled medical researcher, and his assistant, who’d lived with the group? Each could’ve taken the witness stand independently, untainted by the suggestion of a plea arrangement or some type of deal.

writing of the study and its parallels to hippies in the Haight in Love Needs Care, Smith admitted that “it has yet to be determined whether amphetamines modify the personality primarily by biochemically altering the central nervous system or by reinforcing or precipitating long-term psychological tendencies.” Strikingly, as Bugliosi had it, those “psychological tendencies” were exactly what Manson had learned to exploit.

More significant than the contradiction, I felt, was the article’s obscurity: when the HAFMC republished bound editions of all the Journals five years later, “Acute Amphetamine Toxicity” wasn’t included in the collection. All the annotations referring to it in other Journal articles had been removed, too. Just as Manson’s time in the Haight was “extricated” from the record at trial, the study by the two Smiths and Alan Rose—a study into the origins of the same psychological tendencies found in members of the Manson Family—had disappeared.

Late in the fall of 1966, Jolly West arrived in San Francisco to study hippies and LSD. The Bay Area had seen an unprecedented migration of middle-class youth and an explosion of recreational drug use. West felt he had to witness it firsthand. He secured a government grant and took a yearlong sabbatical from his professorship at the University of Oklahoma, nominally to pursue a fellowship at Stanford, although that school had no record of his participation in a program there.

When West cautioned against the “LSD cults” springing up in America’s “bohemian” quarters, he described exactly the kind of disenchanted wanderers who’d flock to a personality like Manson’s in the years to come. West had a hunch that alienated kids “with a pathological desire to withdraw from reality” would crave “shared forbidden activity in a group setting to provide a sense of belonging.”

But when it came to elaborating on his findings about implanting memories and controlling thoughts, West skimped on the details. He seemed to have been in a rudimentary phase of his research. Acid, he wrote, made people more difficult to hypnotize; it was better to pair hypnosis with long bouts of isolation and sleep deprivation. Using hypnotic suggestion, he claimed, “a person can be told that it is now a year later and during the course of this year many changes have taken place… so that it is now acceptable for him to discuss matters that he previously felt he should not discuss… An individual who insists he desires to do one thing will reveal that secretly he wishes just the opposite.”

At the National Security Archives in D.C., I found the version of “The Psychophysiological Studies of Hypnosis and Suggestibility” that the CIA had turned over to the Senate. West’s name and affiliation were redacted, as expected. But what shocked me was that the Senate’s version didn’t include West’s nine-page attachment, but rather an unsigned summary. There was no mention of West’s triumphant accomplishment, the replacement of “the memory of a definite event in the life of an individual” with a “fictional event.”

Almost fifteen years later, besieged by reporters after the New York Times alleged that he’d taken part in MKULTRA’s secret LSD experimentation program, West insisted that all of his LSD work “had been confined to animals,” denying any CIA affiliation. When reporters pointed out that he’d received an awful lot of money from the agency, he retorted that he’d had no idea that the Geschickter Fund and other sources were CIA fronts. Legally, the CIA was obligated to tell the University of Oklahoma that one of its faculty had been on the agency payroll. Oklahoma revealed a heavily redacted memo saying that an unnamed professor—West, I confirmed through financial records—had been investigating “a number of dissociative phenomena” on humans “in the lab,” including an exceptionally rare clinical disorder known as “latah,” “a neurotic condition marked by automatic obedience.”

Libra, Don DeLillo’s 1988 novel about Lee Harvey Oswald, features a character named Nicholas Branch—a retired CIA analyst tasked with internally reviewing the agency’s conduct in the JFK assassination, once and for all. The assignment swallows him for fifteen years. The agency pays for the construction of a lavish, fireproof home office, which becomes, to Branch, “the book-filled room, the room of documents, the room of theories and dreams.” He reposes in “a glove-leather armchair,” surrounded by shelves and filing cabinets bursting with folders, cassettes, legal pads, and books. Branch “sits in the data-spew of hundreds of lives.” He comes to feel that “the past is changing as he writes.” And his ultimate subject, he knows, isn’t crime or politics. It’s “men in small rooms.”

It couldn’t be the case that the truth involved a drug burn gone wrong, orgies with Hollywood elite, a counterinsurgency-trained CIA infiltrator in the Family, a series of unusually lax sheriff’s deputies and district attorneys and judges and parole officers, an FBI plot to smear leftists and Black Panthers, an effort to see if research on drugged mice applied to hippies, and LSD mind-control experiments tested in the field… could it?

It’s when someone claims that I’ve “found the truth” that I get anxious. I haven’t found the truth, much as I wish I could say I have. My goal isn’t to say what did happen—it’s to prove that the official story didn’t. I’ve learned to accept the ambiguity. I had to, I realized, if I ever wanted to finish this book. For every chapter here, there are a dozen I’ve left out. There’s more, there’s always more.

This position assumes a certain amount of complacency in the public. If the truth turns out to exist on a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy, on the 3,005th page of a transcript so dry that no one has read it from start to finish, they’re counting on our not caring. To get to that kernel of truth, you have to generate a paper trail of your own: of FOIA requests, public hearings, and concerned letters to your congressperson, all eventually housed in their own sleepy archives.

Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style "concerted cultivation." It's an attempt to actively "foster and assess a child's talents, opinions and skills." Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of "accomplishment of natural growth." They see as their responsibility to care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own.

“Na véspera da crise econômica mundial na década de 1920, com as suas extremas oposições sociais, houve muitos representantes dos trabalhadores e ativistas radicais que denunciaram o excesso dos ricos e a miséria dos pobres. No século XXI, em contrapartida, uma ninhada numerosa e inteiramente diferente de ideólogos disseminou o contrário – que, em nossa sociedade profundamente desigual, tudo estaria bem, e que, para aqueles que se esforçassem, ficaria ainda melhor. Motivadores e outros representantes do pensamento positivo tinham uma boa oferta para as pessoas que, por causa do mercado de trabalho constantemente oscilante, estavam à beira da ruína econômica: Dê boas-vindas a toda ‘mudança’ angustiante e a veja como uma oportunidade”

‘If Prost wants to come back and win another title, he should be sportive,’ Senna said at the press conference after the race at Estoril, with Mansell and Berger at his side. ‘The way he is doing it, he is behaving like a coward. He must be prepared to race anybody in any conditions, on equal terms, and not the way he wants to win the championship. It’s like if you go into a 100-metre sprint and you want to have running shoes and everybody else should have lead shoes. That’s the way he wants to race. That is not racing.’ The change in his peers’ attitude towards Prost over the years could be measured in the broad smiles of Mansell and Berger.

This was absurd. I was probably the best student he’d had in ten years. The only time I’d even come close to crossing him was in my first semester. I had chosen to do an oral report on Uriah P. Levy, who was a great American naval officer. During the course of my research, I discovered the derivation of the word “fuck.” It came from the early naval logs that the captain would keep. If a crew member was punished for having sexual intercourse, it was noted in the log as “FUCK” (for unlawful carnal knowledge). That was too good a factoid not to share with the class.

Dor é distinção [Unterschied]. Ela articula a vida. Órgãos corporais se fazem conhecer primeiramente pelo seu próprio dialeto de dor. A dor marca os limites, destaca distinções. Sem a dor, tanto o corpo como o mundo afundam em uma in-diferença [In-Differenz].

A vida sem dor e com felicidade permanente não será mais uma vida humana. A vida que persegue e expulsa a sua dor suspende a si mesma. Morte e dor são inseparáveis. Na dor, antecipa-se a morte. Quem deseja eliminar toda dor também terá que acabar com a morte. Mas a vida sem morte e dor não é uma vida humana, mas sim morta-viva. O ser humano se desfaz, a fim de sobreviver. Ele alcançará, possivelmente, a imortalidade, mas ao custo de sua vida.

One day I showed up to rehearsal, and Flea and John were blazing on pot and in a “Let’s ignore Anthony” state of mind, and I experienced this melancholy sense of loss that John was no longer in my world. I could tell from the way he was looking at me that we weren’t really friends anymore, other than the fact that we were in a band together and respected each other on that level. I rode home from rehearsal that day on the 101 Freeway, and my sense of loss about John and the loneliness that I was feeling triggered memories of my time with Ione and how I’d had this beautiful angel of a girl who was willing to give me all of her love, and instead of embracing that, I was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting speedballs under a bridge. I felt I had thrown away so much in my life, but I also felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I’d spent so much time wandering the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me. Even if I was a loner in my own band, at least I still felt the presence of the city I lived in. I started freestyling some poetry in my car and putting the words to a melody and sang all the way down the freeway. When I got home, I got out my notebook and wrote the whole thing down in a song structure, even though it was meant to be a poem to deal with my own anguish.

I don’t want to give the impression that we were monks the whole time we recorded. We’d often invite friends up to the house and have these elaborate dinner parties. One of the people who was around then was the actor River Phoenix. I met River through Ione, who’d done a film with him. John and River had jammed at a party that we all attended, and they got close. I don’t want to go off on River’s trip, because his family is excruciatingly sensitive about it, but since I’d known him, he had drunk heavily and used cocaine heavily, and it was no secret to me or anybody who knew him that he was quite out of control with this stuff and it would be just a matter of time before bad things started to add up. River was around a lot during the writing and recording of our album. He was a big supporter of our band, and I even wrote a whole verse about him in “Give It Away”: “There’s a river, born to be a giver, keep you warm, won’t let you shiver/His heart is never going to wither, come on everybody, time to deliver.”

Back in L.A., the songs were coming fast and furious. Except for one. The first song that John and I worked on, even before we convened in Flea’s garage, was a song called “Californication.” I’d written the lyrics when I was on that cleansing trip to Thailand, when the idea of John being back in the band was still inconceivable to me. While I was on a boat in the Andaman Sea, the melody had crept up on me, one of those simple melody structures that lends itself to flying words into. One of the things that struck me on my travels to exotic places, including the Sea Gypsy Village in Thailand and the bazaars of Indonesia, was the extent to which American culture had permeated all these places, even to the time of bootleg Red Hot Chili Peppers T-shirts. When I was in Auckland one time, I ran into a crazy lady on the street, and she was ranting about the fact that there were psychic spies in China. That phrase stuck in my mind, so when I was back home, I started writing and writing, and they became my favorite of all the lyrics that I’d collected over the last year.

All those ideas were in the air when John started playing this guitar riff, and I immediately knew what the song was about. It was a playful, happy-to-be-alive, phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes vibe. I ran outside with my handheld tape recorder and, with that music playing in the background, started singing the entire chorus to the song. I’ll never forget looking up at the sky above that garage, out toward Griffith Park with the birds flying overhead, and getting a dose of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. I really did have the point of view of those birds, feeling like an eternal outsider.

The people who lived westward of this mountain rampart, knowing but little or nothing of the country on the other side, designated it as Transylvania, or the land beyond the forest, just as we sometimes talk of the " land beyond the clouds."

Although the Hungarian kings generally kept their given word right nobly to the immigrants, yet these had much to suffer, both from Hungarian nobles jealous of the privileges they enjoyed, and from the older inhabitants of the soil, the Wallachians, who, living in a thoroughly barbaric state up in the mountains, used to make frequent raids down into the valleys and plains, there to pillage, burn, and murder whatever came into their hands. If we add to this the frequent invasions of Turks and Tartars, it seems a marvel how this little handful of Germans, brought into a strange country and surrounded by enemies on all sides, should have maintained their independence and preserved their identity under spch combination of adverse circumstances. They built churches and fortresses, they formed schools and guilds, they made their own laws and elected their own judges; and in an age when Hungarian nobles could scarcely read or write, these little German colonies were so many havens of civilization in the midst of a howling wilderness of ignorance and barbarism.

After BometWng more than a ceutury and a half of independence, Transylvania began to feel its position as an independent State to be an untenable one, and that its ultimate choice lay between complete subjection to either Turkey or Austria. Making, therefore, a virtue of necessity, and hoping thereby to escape the degradation of a conquered province, Transylvania offered itself to Austria, and was by special treaty enrolled in the Crown lands of that empire in 1691.

The notion of sorcery has existed at all times in all cultures. All through the ages some special people have been thought to be gifted with magical powers. But the Western European concept of witchcraft is something more specific than magic. The historian G. L. Burr wrote in 1890: "Magic itself is actual and universal. But witchcraft never was. It was but a shadow, a nightmare: the nightmare of a religion, the shadow of a dogma. Less than five centuries saw its birth, its vigor, its decay."

Macfarlane's theory of the genesis of witchcraft accusations is more specific than that of the need to find cause of misfortune, though it is compatible with it. He believes that the supplicants created guilt in those who refused them; the guilt turned to anger; then the anger was projected back on the supplicants. By this process the women who had asked for assistance became repositories for feelings their neighbors disliked in themselves.

The old ethos of helpfulness toward neighbors was in conflict with the growing emphasis on fulfilling individual needs and desires. At the same time, the traditional sources of support for the poor, the Church and the manor, could no longer be counted on. People still felt a moral obligation to help their neighbors, but the growth of belief in self-help and the increasing demands from those unprovided for made them less willing to give. The less affluent—not the destitute, who were treated as criminals—thus created the feelings of guilt which in due course led the withholders of help to suspect them of avenging themselves by devilish means.

All of these views may have some or much truth in them. But it also seems likely that people accuse women, not men, of witchcraft for the reason that, in all Western cultures, girls and women subtly torment each other with words, looks, or silences while boys and grown men physically fight or shout blatant insults. Women's habitually more covert tactics in any struggle for power make them more suspect when the methods of attack are invisible.

All the English Puritans' sixteenth-century witchcraft beliefs, though on the wane in the homeland, were still current in New England in 1692. But all such beliefs were the products of the human imagination with no basis in fact. There is no reason whatsoever to believe Tituba guilty of anything. Apart, that is, from being a Caribbean Indian slave in a New England parsonage at a most unfortunate moment.

It would be hard to exaggerate the terror inspired in the settlers by the native Americans. Unsurprisingly, they had responded to the white people's cruelty, treachery, and injustice with merciless fury. When the English first arrived, the Indians had welcomed and aided them. But the English took their lands, broke treaties, and killed and enslaved them. They also, less culpably, infected them with smallpox and other diseases to which the native people had no immunity, cutting their numbers by three-quarters in less than fifty years.

Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation (“Sectumsempra!”) scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “For Enemies,” and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.

“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.” “I don’t quite understand how that works, though, sir,” said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. “Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form…”

But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.

“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected. “The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.” “Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it…” said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more. “Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.

And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent’s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been before.

O que se passou naquele cérebro ainda verde, mas já robusto, foi uma resolução sem plano. Deslindar o vínculo espúrio era o essencial e urgente, não cogitou no modo. Sua inocência, assim como lhe dissimulava toda extensão possível do mal, assim também lhe encobria as asperezas e os óbices da execução. Era o coração que lhe designava esse papel de anjo guardador. Natureza simples e intacta, ia direito ao fim sem o temor que dá a experiência e a contemplação da vida. Quem sabe? Não conhecia a hipocrisia, mas acabava de suspeitá-la; começava talvez a aprendê-la.

A figura terna e virginal de Iaiá aparecera-lhe um dia, subitamente, como uma visão não sonhada. Se ele a visse em algum salão aristocrático pensaria nela numa noite, talvez uma semana, até esquecê-la ou substituí-la. Mas o que o prendeu a Iaiá Garcia foi justamente a mediocridade do nascimento. Possuí-la era fazer-lhe um favor. Quantas outras lhe não levaram os olhos de sátiro, ao descer de uma carruagem, ou ao resvalar indolentemente o seu talhe na contradança de bom-tom? Ele via-as passar ou estar, com os ombros nus ou cingidos da caxemira elegante, risonhas umas, outras sérias, todas altivas e compassadas, e sentia que os anos, feições e maneiras o distanciavam delas; não era difícil apagá-las da memória.

Jorge fingiu não atender ao gesto e ao tom do pai de Estela, e tratou de o converter à pontualidade, obra que começava a ser difícil, porque o Sr. Antunes entrava já nas conseqüências lógicas e naturais de uma longa dependência; preferia o favor ao trabalho, e os anos contribuíam para esse amor da inércia e do benefício gratuito. A maior ambição que o animou, se a fortuna a houvera realizado, dar-lhe-ia todos os meios de envelhecer tranqüilo. Agora tinha encanecido, e o corpo, embora lesto, começava a suspirar pela inação.

Se alguma vez o reconheceste, não foi ontem; ontem cedeste a um mau preconceito contra as madrastas, e levantaste entre mim e ti um espectro, que se pudesse falar seria para te condenar também. Não me queixo, nunca me queixei de cousa nenhuma: quando estimo alguém, perdôo; quando não estimo, esqueço. Perdoar e esquecer é raro, mas não é impossível; está nas tuas mãos.

Iaiá escutava-o como encantada, mas sem olhar para ele. Quando Jorge acabou, fez-se entre ambos uma longa pausa. A moça tinha os olhos no horizonte onde as cores da tarde desmaiavam rapidamente. Jorge contemplava-a tomado de interesse e até de inveja; compreendia os primeiros sobressaltos desse coração em flor, e dizia a si mesmo que há sensações que o tempo leva para não restituir mais.

Homero conta que Vênus, descendo ao campo da batalha entre gregos e troianos, saiu dali ferida e ensangüentada. Iaiá teve a sorte da diva homérica; interpondo-se entre Jorge e Estela trouxe dali ferido o coração. Naquele espaço de alguns meses, obra de paciência e luta, de violência e simulação, para a qual fizera convergir todas as forças morais, não suspeitou que, vencendo ao outro, podia vencer-se a si mesma. Queria ser uma barreira entre o passado e o presente, sem cogitar na dificuldade do plano, nem nas conseqüências possíveis dele. Sobretudo, não pensou na moralidade da ação. Que podia ela saber disto? A suspeita ia até admitir a persistência do amor no coração da madrasta, mas não lhe atribuía mais do que uma aspiração ou saudade silenciosa; não sabia mais. Para combater esse inimigo inerte, é que pôs em campo a porção de astúcia que a natureza lhe dera, as graças do rosto e a rara penetração de espírito.

Olhou longamente para ela; a extinção da esperança não implicava a extinção do desejo; pelo contrário, vinha pungi-lo e açulá-lo. Seus olhos mostraram então duas expressões diversas; a primeira involuntária, a mesma com que os dous velhos de Israel espreitavam a filha de Helcias, um olhar terreno e mau; a segunda voluntária, não de queixa, não de súplica, mas de lástima.

Luís Garcia foi o laço que ainda pode conservar atadas essas duas existências, já agora antipáticas uma à outra. A vida dele era necessária a ambas. Uma punha nela todas as esperanças de um coração crédulo; outra apenas lhe dava aquela porção última, que não desampara os necessitados. Tréguas houve, mas sombrias e violentas. Não se falavam as duas, não trocavam um só olhar na ausência de Luís Garcia; diante dele, mostravam-se como dantes. Esta situação incomportável parecia, aliás, definitiva.

No primeiro aniversário da morte de Luís Garcia Iaiá foi com o marido ao cemitério, a fim de depositar na sepultura do pai uma coroa de saudades. Outra coroa havia sido ali posta, com uma fita em que se liam estas palavras: A meu marido. Iaiá beijou com ardor a singela dedicatória, como beijaria a madrasta se ela lhe aparecesse naquele instante. Era sincera a piedade da viúva. Alguma cousa escapa ao naufrágio das ilusões.

Assim, para os jusnaturalistas, os direitos do homem são imperativos do direito natural, anteriores e superiores à vontade do Estado. Já para os positivistas, os direitos do homem são faculdades outorgadas pela lei e reguladas por ela. Para os idealistas, os direitos humanos são ideias, princípios abstratos que a realidade vai acolhendo ao longo do tempo, ao passo que, para os realistas, seriam o resultado direto de lutas sociais e políticas.

Não basta, assim, que um direito encontre bons motivos filosóficos, aceitos no momento, para ser positivado; é indispensável, ainda, o concurso de condições sociais e históricas favoráveis para que se incorpore aos estatutos vinculantes.

O fenômeno leva Bobbio a concluir que os direitos não nascem todos de uma só vez, “nascem quando devem ou podem nascer. Nascem quando o aumento do poder do homem sobre o homem cria novas ameaças à liberdade do indivíduo ou permite novos remédios para as suas indigências: ameaças que são enfrentadas através de demandas de limitação de poder; remédios que são providenciados através da exigência de que o mesmo poder intervenha de modo protetor”

Inalienável é um direito ou uma coisa em relação a que estão excluídos quaisquer atos de disposição, quer jurídica – renúncia, compra e venda, doação –, quer material – destruição material do bem. Isso significa que um direito inalienável não admite que o seu titular o torne impossível de ser exercitado para si mesmo, física ou juridicamente

A tentativa de definir a democracia como “regime de direitos” é ridícula porque não existem direitos sem deveres, por isso a ideia de que piolhos ou frangos tenham direitos começa a aparecer quando separamos direitos de sua contrapartida anterior, os deveres.

It is because of this assumption that, without citing any additional material, he speaks self-confidently of Dr. Dostoevsky as having been “especially violent in reality” (italics added) toward Feodor, and of the boy as having developed, over and above the normal Oedipal antagonism, an intense death wish against his father. It was the inner conflict between this death wish (assimilated into an ego predisposed to bisexuality, hence to masochism) and a severe superego (incorporating all the harshness and cruelty of the sadistic father) which, in Freud’s view, triggered the first epileptic crisis when the death wish was transformed from fantasy into reality.

It is very likely that Dostoevsky had heard just such reproaches on numerous occasions, and had tried to excuse them in his heart in the same way. And we see that he depicts his father, not as a brutal and heartless despot, but as a harassed and finally pitiable figure driven to desperation by the difficulties of his situation.

Dostoevsky’s genius first reveals itself by the creation of characters desperately eager to satisfy their bureaucratic superiors in some routine clerical task (not so far removed from schoolwork, after all); consumed with guilt at their velleities of rebellion; and oppressed by their sense of social inferiority. No wonder! All through his childhood, Dostoevsky had been placed psychically in exactly the same position by his father, and by the obvious social situation of his family.

Whether one calls such a sacrifice moral masochism like Freud or, more traditionally, moral self-conquest, the fact remains that Dostoevsky as a boy and youth was not only hostile and inimical to his father but also struggled to understand and to forgive him.

The attempt of theologians to rationalize the mysteries of faith, it would appear, never held any appeal to Dostoevsky from the very beginning. But what stirred his feelings to the depths was the story of the Advent as a divine-human narrative full of character and action-as an account of real people living and responding with passion and fervor to the word of God.

Dr. Dostoevsky, when he could find time in the evenings (and he seems to have done so more often than not), also offered his children more serious provender. What he read them was Karamzin’s History of the Russian State, the first work to disinter the Russian past from dusty monkish chronicles and poetic legend, and to present it as a national epic appealing to a wide circle of cultivated readers: Karamzin, as Pushkin remarked, discovered the Russian past as Columbus had discovered America.

Dostoevsky thus first came across these two ideas–that moral consciousness (conscience) is an ineradicable part of human nature, and that immortality is a necessary condition of any world order claiming to make moral sense-when he read Karamzin as a boy; and what he acquired subsequently only built on this foundation.

The parents also introduced the children to the work of their favorite poet, Zhukovsky, who was strongly influenced by the English “graveyard school” of Gray and Young and by the ballad-poetry of the German Romantics. No doubt Zhukovsky appealed to the elder Dostoevskys because of his melancholy disenchantment with earthly life and his nostalgia for a realm of bliss beyond the grave.

Unlike Dr. Dostoevsky, Russian parents of the upper class for the most part took very little personal interest in the education of their children; they turned them over to foreign tutors and governesses as soon as they were out of swaddling bands to acquire the requisite polish of European manners. As a result, while the young Russian nobleman more often than not would be “at home in the literature and history of Western Europe,” he was apt to be “quite ignorant of Russian letters and the past of his own homeland.”

M. H. Abrams, with his usual authority, has recently sharpened our awareness of the extent to which the “characteristic concepts and patterns of Romantic philosophy and literature are a displaced and reconstituted theology”14 and represent a return to Christian fashions of feeling. “A conspicuous Romantic tendency, after the rationalism and decorum of the Enlightenment,” he writes, “was a reversion to the stark drama and suprarational mysteries of the Christian story and doctrines and to the violent conflicts and abrupt reversals of the Christian inner life, turning on extremes of destruction and creation, hell and heaven, exile and reunion, death and rebirth, dejection and joy, paradise lost and paradise regained.”

Nor should one underestimate the future influence of Shidlovsky’s living demonstration that intense religious commitment could be combined with a frank confession of the torments of doubt; genuine faith for Dostoevsky would never afterwards be confused with a tranquil acceptance of dogma. Dostoevsky, it is true, soon left this Romantic phase behind, and often later parodied and satirized various types of Romantic egoism. But the Romantic dissatisfaction with the limits of earthly life and, in particular, its positive valuation of moral suffering, always remained a permanent feature of his own world view.

There has been a good deal of discussion about Hoffmann’s influence on Dostoevsky; but the German writer’s effect on Russian literature was so all-pervasive that it is difficult to isolate Dostoevsky’s particular debt to him with any precision. Dostoevsky had already read both Pushkin (The Queen of Spades is distinctly Hoffmannesque) as well as Veltman, with his use of the double as a structural device; and the early stories of Gogol also are very much influenced by Hoffmann. Nonetheless, Dostoevsky probably learned a good deal at first hand from Hoffmann’s genius for depicting pathological emotional states and subconscious criminal impulses, as well as for creating a unique poetic atmosphere–a blend of the realistically trivial with a richly imaginative and fantastic dream world. Many years later, in comparing Hoffmann with Poe, Dostoevsky expressed a preference for the German over what he considered the too practical and too down-to-earth American. Poe, he said, confined his fantasy only to the framework of his stories; once given the situation, everything else is presented with startling exactitude and verisimilitude. Hoffmann, on the other hand, “personifies the forces of nature in images,” allows the supernatural to intrude overtly, and “even sometimes seeks his ideal outside the confines of the earthly.” This, in Dostoevsky’s view, makes Hoffmann “immeasurably superior to Poe as a poet” (XIII: 524). Despite this preference, Dostoevsky’s own work is closer to Poe than to Hoffmann: he too has an uncanny ability to visualize and dramatize the extraordinary within the conventions of realism, and without any supernatural intrusion.

“But just to see the harsh covering under which the universe languishes, to know that one explosion of the will is enough to shatter it and to fuse with the eternal, to know and to remain like the lowliest of mortals . . . that’s terrible! How cowardly man is! Hamlet! Hamlet! When I recall those raging, savage speeches, in which sound the groans of a lifeless world, neither a sad murmur nor reproach plucks at my breast. . . . My soul is so crushed by sorrow, that one is afraid to understand it for fear of being tom apart.”5 Hamlet’s failure to shatter the universe and “fuse with the eternal” here becomes a sign of man’s degradation: humanity is not strong enough to live up to its own exalted self-awareness. Dostoevsky’s accusation of “cowardice” leveled against Hamlet will one day be repeated in Raskolnikov’s frenzied self-accusations because of his inability to be a “Napoleon,” and inwardly remaining only one of “the lowliest of mortals.” Nor would Dostoevsky forget the idea of suicide-of an “explosion of the will”–as a supreme gesture of metaphysical defiance when he comes to create the character of Kirillov in The Devils.

It was Balzac who took over the historical novel of Scott and used it for the treatment of contemporary social life, substituting the deceptive calm of the French provinces and the glittering kaleidoscope of Paris for Scott’s Highland glens and medieval or Near Eastern pageantry. It was Balzac who first spoke of Scott as having taught him that the modern novel was “un drame dialogué”;* and no one would develop the form in this direction more brilliantly than Dostoevsky. Only Balzac, of all of Dostoevsky’s contemporaries, can compare with him in uniting a visionary social observation of astonishing exactitude with inner dramas of the soul that span the entire range of moral experience from the Satanic to the divine.

Like the other members of his generation who came to maturity in the mid-1830s, Dostoevsky always remained stamped with the complex cultural physiognomy of the time. Indeed, one of the secrets of his genius may well have been his refusal ever to decide emotively between the personal and literary tensions created by his equal devotion to the two Romanticisms. On the one hand, we see his commitment to the supernatural, other-worldly and more traditionally Christian outlook of metaphysical Romanticism–Christian at least in spirit, and even though the artist is substituted for the priest and the saint. But, on the other hand, we also have the strong tug of his feelings toward the practical application of the Christian values of pity and love–toward the “philanthropic” ground swell of the French social Romanticism flooding in ever more irresistibly after 1830.

The supreme value attributed to suffering comes into conflict with compassion for the weak and the oppressed; the need to justify God’s ways to man clashes with the desire to refashion the world. Dostoevsky felt the competing pull of both these moral and religious imperatives, and the balance of their opposing pressures helps to account for the unremitting tragic impact of his best work.

These are the major events of Dostoevsky’s life during this five-year period; and what they show is that, beginning in 1843, he began seriously to try to carve out a place for himself in the St. Petersburg Grub Street. This date, as we know, marked the beginning of the major mutation in his literary ideas that extended over the next two years. Since these years coincide quite exactly with the movement of Russian literature from Romanticism to social Realism, Dostoevsky’s personal development can best be understood in the context of this more general evolution.

Indeed, with his subtle analyses of the secret recesses of a moral conscience divided against itself, no earlier writer is closer to Dostoevsky’s psychology than the devoutly Christian Jansenist Racine.* Corneille also arouses Dostoevsky’s enthusiasm, and he remarks that “with his gigantic characters and Romantic soul he is almost Shakespeare.”13 Such comments display Dostoevsky’s admirable independence of judgment, his ability to appreciate creative force wherever he finds it regardless of literary fashion. They also indicate his preoccupation with the theater at this time as a source for his own inspiration.

By 1844, in a survey of Russian literature of the previous year, Belinsky was already hailing the appearance of a new school which, though it “can barely count more than a dozen true representatives,” nonetheless “is more fertile and vital than all the others” on the Russian scene. This school “deals with the most vital problems of life, destroys the old inveterate prejudices and raises its voice in indignation against the deplorable aspects of contemporary morals and manners, laying bare in all its stark and grim reality ‘all that is constantly before the gaze, but which unseeing eyes heed not, all the frightful appalling mass of trivialities in which our life is steeped, all the depth of cold, disintegrated everyday characters with which our earth teems.’

Until 1842, and despite his sympathy for the compassionate humanitarianism of the French social Romantics, it is clear that Dostoevsky was still laboring in the literary traces of the dominant taste of the 1830s. There had been, after all, no current of critical opinion in Russia indicating any other direction to follow for a young aspirant to literary fame. Belinsky’s campaign on behalf of Gogol, however, and the transformation of Notes of the Fatherland into a Russian outpost of the French “Socialist” tendency, changed the entire picture at one stroke.

There are, in any case, extremely intriguing resemblances between Sand’s remarkable and little-read novel (a combination of Gothic mystery story and spiritual autobiography) and certain features in The Brothers Karamazov. Both are set in a monastery; both involve the transmission of an ancient and semi-heretical religious tradition; both stress that true religion should depend only on free moral choice, not on the tyranny of dogma or institutions; both contain as central characters an old and dying monk–the inheritor of this tradition, who is hated by his fellow monks–and an ardent young disciple inspired by his doctrine and his example; both dramatize the struggle between skeptical reason and true faith.

Pushkin, in other words, pointed the way for Dostoevsky to overcome his Romanticism without turning into a mere imitator of Gogol; the “vision” symbolizes the moment when Dostoevsky became aware of how, by following the example of Pushkin, he could join the new Gogolian trend and affirm his artistic originality at the same time.

Dostoevsky was the first writer who, having chosen his material within the thematic range of the Natural School, had managed to produce more than a series of physiological sketches. “I am very often at Belinsky’s,” he writes Mikhail in the fall of 1845. “He is as well-disposed to me as one possibly could be, and seriously sees in me a public proof and justification of his opinions.”4 Dostoevsky’s comment hits the nail very accurately on the head. He had succeeded in producing the work that Belinsky had been waiting for; and the immense stir created by Poor Folk among contemporaries is to a large degree attributable to the controversy over the new orientation that Belinsky had given to Russian literature.

This “different view of God’s world,” the world as seen from below rather than above, constitutes the major innovation of Dostoevsky vis-à-vis Gogol, whose sympathy with his humble protagonists is never strong enough to overcome the condescension implicit in his narrative stance. The “humanism” that Belinsky hailed in Dostoevsky’s work consists precisely in “having shown how much that is excellent, noble, and sacred is contained in the most limited of human natures.”7 The situations and the psychology of Poor Folk thus speak for themselves against class pride and class prejudice, and against the presumed superiority of the upper over the lower.

In Poor Folk, this tension between the spiritual and the material is still latent and in a state of equilibrium; the emphasis accorded the spiritual (or, if one prefers, the moral-psychological) dimension of human experience only heightens the pathos of the material injustices that Dostoevsky’s characters have to suffer.

This is the beginning of the end for Devushkin, as the book shifts from the theme of poverty to that of the impossibility of retaining Varvara. It is true that Varvara is a victim of her situation and her past; but even under the best of circumstances she could not have continued to play the role in Devushkin’s life that he would have wished. That the General’s charitable gesture did not solve all of Devushkin’s problems for good has been interpreted, in recent Soviet criticism, as an indication that Dostoevsky wished to point to the necessity for a more radical change of the social order.9 But it is much more likely that he was projecting his theme in a wider context, where the social is only one component of a still more complex human imbroglio. And the fate of Gorshkov, who dies on the very day he is fully vindicated and restored to honor and security, again illustrates Dostoevsky’s awareness of human problems for which, properly speaking, there is no social solution at all.

There has been a good deal of discussion in Russian criticism over whether, in his first work, Dostoevsky should be considered a follower or an antagonist of Gogol. Dostoevsky’s contemporaries saw him primarily as a follower; more recent critics have focused rather on his “parodistic” transformation of Gogolian characters and motifs, which he converts from the tonality of grotesque, fantastic comedy into that of sentimental tragicomedy.

Gogol’s narrative technique works to create a comic distance between character and reader that defeats emotional identification; Dostoevsky counteracts the purely satirical features of the model by taking over its elements and, through his use of the sentimental epistolary form, reshaping them to accentuate Devushkin’s humanity and sensibility.

“Dostoevsky’s novel Poor Folk,” writes Vinogradov, “was the first act in the artistic realization of a tendency, noticeable among the ideologues of the [Natural School], in the direction of a unification of Gogolian form with sentimentalism (especially in that aspect of sentimentalism that was reborn in ‘philanthropic’ French literature).”

The moving authenticity of Poor Folk tells us quite the opposite in every line; but we must always remember that Dostoevsky’s perceptions are oriented by his artistic intentions, and that these are shaped by his relation to the literary and cultural values of his period. No approach to Dostoevsky can be truly satisfactory if it is unable to encompass both these facets of his work, and to clarify how they interact with each other.

Dostoevsky was preeminently a “dialogic” personality, who lived intensely in the stream of Russian social-cultural life and projected himself passionately into the issues raised by the Russian world of his time. Just as we have seen to be true for Poor Folk, his works will always continue to be responses to questions posed by the Russian literary tradition, and by the wracking conflicts and debates dominating the social-cultural climate at the moment of their conception.

With his usual impetuosity and wholeheartedness, Belinsky immediately adopted the young author as an intimate and spoke of him to others with unconstrained affection; Turgenev describes his attitude as being positively paternal. “ ‘Yes,’ he [Belinsky] used to say proudly, as though he had himself been responsible for some terrific achievement, ‘yes, my dear fellow, let me tell you it may be a tiny bird,’ and he would put his hand about a foot from the floor to show how tiny it was, ‘but it’s got sharp claws.’ Imagine my surprise when I met Mr. Dostoevsky a little later and saw before me a man of more than medium height, taller than Belinsky himself at any rate. But in his access of paternal tenderness to a newly discovered talent, Belinsky treated him like a son, just as if he were his own little boy.’ “

“Recently the poet Turgenev came back from Paris (you must have heard),” he tells Mikhail, “and he attached himself to me at first sight with such devotion that Belinsky explains it by saying he has fallen in love with me! And what a man, brother! I have all but fallen in love with him myself. A poet, an aristocrat, talented, handsome, rich, intelligent, well-educated, and twenty-five years old. And, to conclude, a noble character, infinitely direct and open, formed in a good school. Read his story Andrey Kolosov in the Notes of the Fatherland.

The above passage was written the day after Dostoevsky had paid his first visit to the salon of the Panaevs, which had become the favorite rendezvous for Belinsky and his group. Weak-willed, good-natured, dissipated, with a knack for writing amusing satirical sketches of fashionable Petersburg life, the amiable Panaev was everybody’s friend. His wife Avdotya was not only a famous beauty but the most notable bluestocking of her time, who also achieved some notoriety as a novelist. Already, or soon to become, Nekrasov’s mistress (he lived with the Panaevs in a peaceful ménage à trois for ten years), she was at the center of mid-nineteenth century Russian literary life, and her Memoirs give one of the best behind-the-scenes portraits of the period. “Dostoevsky visited us for the first time in the evening with Nekrasov and Grigorovich,” she writes, “who had just begun their literary careers. It was evident, from only one glance at Dostoevsky, that he was a terribly nervous and impressionable person. He was slender, short, fair-haired, with a sickly complexion; his small gray eyes darted somewhat uneasily from object to object, and his colorless lips were nervously contorted. He already knew almost all of our guests, but, clearly, he was disconcerted and did not take part in the general conversation. Everyone tried to involve him, so as to overcome his shyness, and to make him feel that he was a member of the circle.”

It is likely, though, that Dostoevsky described them in The Insulted and Injured, a novel which contains a good many autobiographical details about his life during the mid-1840s. The narrator, an impoverished young author, writes: “I gradually began at dusk to sink into that condition which is so common with me now at night in my illness, and which I call mystic terror. It is a most oppressive, agonizing state of terror of something that I cannot define, something ungraspable and outside the natural order of things, but which may yet take shape this very minute, as though in mockery of all the conclusions of reason, and come to me and stand before me as an undeniable fact, hideous, horrible, and relentless. This fear usually becomes more and more acute, in spite of all the protests of reason, so much so that although the mind sometimes is of exceptional clarity at such moments, it loses all power of resistance. It is unheeded, it becomes useless, and this inward division intensifies the agony of suspense. It seems to me something like the anguish of people who are afraid of the dead. But in my distress the indefiniteness of the apprehension makes my suffering even more acute”

Even though not very edifying, Dostoevsky’s harrowing encounter with the pléiade is worth dwelling on for a number of reasons. The image it gives us of Dostoevsky as a personality does help to illuminate one of the main sources of the characters he created and of the type of world in which they live. If Dostoevsky displays such a remarkable ability to portray feelings and states of suspicion, persecution, and of exasperation reaching a pitch of hysteria, and if he has a tendency to see human relations solely in terms of a struggle for psychic domination, the reason is surely that he was all too familiar with such phenomena in his own psyche. The combination of excessive vainglory and egoism with an equal desire for acceptance, appreciation, and love is one that he often depicted; and these same incompatibles are manifest in his disastrous relations with the pléiade.

Even before meeting Belinsky personally, the writings of the critic in the mid-1840s had marked out the path to his own artistic self-discovery. And the memory of the moment when Belinsky had bestowed on him the accolade of fame, whatever the disillusionment following in its wake, served to sustain him in the midst of his worst moments of self-doubt and despair. If for no other reasons, these two would be enough to justify the crucial role that Dostoevsky always assigned to Belinsky in his personal history.

If we take Dostoevsky’s account at face value, it provides an irresistibly hagiographic version of the great drama of his conscience. Before having met Belinsky, he had been a young, pure-hearted, idealistic, naively devout believer in the God and Christ of his childhood faith. It was the passionate and headstrong Belinsky, the revered idol of Russian radical youth, who had succeeded in converting him to Socialism and atheism. The result had been his participation in subversive activity, and then his arrest, conviction, and exile to Siberia. There he rediscovered God and Christ through the Russian people, and came to realize that atheism could lead only to personal and social destruction.

All the Utopian Socialists of any importance in the 1840s saw Christ (much as Dostoevsky had done in 1838) as a divine figure come to prescribe the laws governing the organization of earthly life in the modern world, and whose teachings, freed from centuries of perversion, were at last to be put into practice.

The “New Christianity” of Utopian Socialism was based on an opposition between the true religion of Jesus Christ–a religion of hope and light, of faith in the powers of man as well as in the beneficence of God-and a false religion of fear and eternal damnation.

Max Stirner’s The Ego and His Own. Stirner argued that the acceptance of any abstract or general moral value was an impediment to man’s freedom, and alienated his personality as much as a belief in supernatural beings. Of no group was he more scornful, no antagonist did he attack more mercilessly, than the Socialists and liberals still clinging to their general ideal of “Humanity.” What is fundamental for the individual ego, according to Stirner, is simply the satisfaction of its own needs, whatever these may be; his philosophy is that of a totally subjective and totally amoral self-aggrandizement.

What is important, though, is Belinsky’s evident willingness to accept Stirner’s non-idealistic view of the roots of human behavior, the critic’s desire to search for a new, more “practical” and “rational” foundation for his values.

Belinsky writes Annenkov early in the spring of 1847,16 bearing out Annenkov’s observation that, in these last two or three years of his life, Belinsky “was concerned with the new, emerging definitions of the rights and obligations of man, with the new truth proclaimed by economic doctrines which was liquidating all notions of the old, displaced truth about the moral, the good and the noble on earth, and was putting in their place formulas and theses of a purely rational character.”

During the span of Dostoevsky’s friendship with Belinsky, the critic was thus moving (or, more exactly, oscillating) between a Feuerbachian “humanism” with moral-religious overtones and the acceptance of a more “rational” viewpoint shading toward mechanistic materialism and moral determinism.

It is striking to see that the quick portrait of Belinsky sketched by Dostoevsky coincides, in its grasp of the essential, with the image that emerges from a study of all the other materials. “Valuing reason, science, and realism above everything,” Dostoevsky writes, “at the same time he [Belinsky] understood more deeply than anyone else that reason, science, and realism alone could construct only an anthill and not a social ‘harmony’ within which it would be possible for mankind to live. He knew that, at the foundation of everything, were moral principles”; and he knew that in attacking Christianity, which was based on the moral responsibility of the individual, he was not only undermining the foundations of the society he wished to destroy but also denying human liberty. But Belinsky also believed, in Dostoevsky’s view, that Socialism would restore the freedom of the personality and raise it to hitherto-undreamed of heights.

“But in those days the matter was seen in the very rosiest and angelically moral light. Really, truthfully, the Socialism then just being born used to be compared, even by some of its ringleaders, with Christianity, and was regarded merely as a corrective to, and improvement of, the latter in accordance with the century and with civilization. All these new ideas pleased us terribly in Petersburg, and seemed in the highest degree holy and moral and, most important, universal, the future law for all mankind without exception. ... By 1846 I had already been consecrated into all the truth of this ‘future regeneration of the world’ and into all the holiness of the future Communistic society by Belinsky.”21

As Dostoevsky presents it, the dialogue begins with Belinsky’s denial that the suffering and oppressed lower classes had any personal moral responsibility for their actions. “ ‘But, do you know,’ he [Belinsky] screamed one evening (sometimes in a state of great excitement he used to scream), ‘do you know that it is impossible to charge man with sins, and to burden him with debts and turning the other cheek, when society is organized so vilely that man cannot help committing crimes, when he is economically pushed into crime, and that it is stupid and cruel to demand from men what, by the very laws of nature, they cannot accomplish even if they wanted to. . . .’ “25 The Belinsky speaking here is obviously no longer the old “humanist” who responded to the emotive appeal of Christian moral-religious values; this is the voice of the admirer of Littré and perhaps also the reader of Max Stirner, who would see the moral will as helpless or nonexistent, and the criminal acts of the oppressed only as a natural and legitimate expression of their “egoistic” needs.

Christ would thus have, quite accurately, joined the movement of the preponderantly Utopian Socialist and moral-religious French; the Left Hegelian Germans are carefully separated from them by Dostoevsky’s judicious phrasing. And the argument on which he reports–the argument not only of Belinsky with Dostoevsky, but also of Belinsky with himself–was really being carried on between the two competing doctrines then disputing for the ideological mastery of the Left throughout the world.

Dostoevsky concludes his portrayal with the following words, which have caused an immense amount of confusion: “In the last year of his [Belinsky’s] life I no longer went to visit him. He had taken a dislike to me, but I was then passionately following all his teaching.”30 As should be clear by now, this simple statement contains a quagmire of complexities and possible interpretations: just what Dostoevsky means by “all his teaching” is terribly vague. Is it the teaching of the moral-religious Utopian Socialism which, deceptively, he says he imbibed from Belinsky, and which was only an “improved” form of Christianity? Is it the teaching of Belinsky’s insulting Left Hegelian tirade against Christ, and his denial of free will and moral responsibility because of the overwhelming weight of “the laws of nature”? What Dostoevsky evidently wants the reader to understand is that he was converted to Belinsky’s atheism and materialism; but there is good reason to doubt this very strongly. For Dostoevsky’s closest friends in the next several years refused to surrender the moral-religious inspiration of Utopian Socialism and were very critical of Belinsky. And we know from one of his fellow-Petrashevtsy that, as Dostoevsky was awaiting execution in 1849, he spoke as a believing Christian who had by no means abandoned his hope of an afterlife in which he would “be with Christ.”

Doug’s version of diff implements an efficient algorithm (invented independently by Harold Stone and Tom Szymanski) for comparing two text files, finding a minimal sequence of changes that will convert one into the other. This code is at the heart of source code control systems that manage multiple versions of files. Such systems most often work by storing one version and a set of diffs, generating other versions by running the diff algorithm. This is also used in the patch mechanism that’s used for updating programs—rather than sending a new version of a program to someone, send a sequence of ed editing commands, computed by diff, that will convert the old version into the new.

Nobody has grasped more profoundly, or portrayed more brilliantly, the tragic inner dialectic of this movement of atheist humanism; and if Dostoevsky had no effective answer to Belinsky in 1845, he amply made up for it later by the creation of his negative heroes. For when such characters reject God and Christ, they invariably engage in the impossible and self-destructive attempt to transcend the human condition, and to incarnate the Left Hegelian dream of replacing the God-man by the Man-god.

This paved the way for his later commitment to an irrationalism for which he had been prepared both by his religious and philosophical education, and by the psychic experience he called “mystic terror.” Like Kierkegaard, with whom he has so often been compared in the last half-century, Dostoevsky also later indicated that a paradoxical “leap of faith” was the only source of religious certainty.

For Dostoevsky’s connection with them seriously calls into question the portrait he painted of himself as he was supposed to have been in the 1840s. Far from being a political innocent, abruptly baptized into Socialism, atheism, and materialism all at once by the great intellectual agitator Belinsky, Dostoevsky was a committed moral-religious progressive who stoutly maintained his convictions in the face of Belinsky’s attacks and then allied himself with others of the same persuasion. This is the image that emerges when we take a closer look at some of the people whom Dostoevsky met in and through the Beketov circle.

Besides the Beketovs themselves, it was there that he became acquainted with the well-known poet, then still a student, Aleksey Pleshcheev, whose name turns up everywhere in the annals of the progressive intelligentsia during the 1840s. The attractive and well-bred scion of an aristocratic family–gentle, tenderhearted, cloudily rhapsodic-Pleshcheev became a very close friend of Dostoevsky; and this friendship continued throughout the remainder of their lives, even though, for political reasons, it turned more formal than cordial beginning in the mid-1860s. During the 1840s, however, the two young men were inseparable, not only personally but also politically–they were in exactly the same groups up to the time of their arrest in 1849, and, as public evidence of their amity, dedicated stories to each other (in Dostoevsky’s case, his charming little masterpiece White Nights). It can scarcely be doubted that the ethos of Pleshcheev’s work would have been close to Dostoevsky’s heart; and Pleshcheev’s poetry, in the words of P. N. Sakulin, “imperceptibly fused the religion of Socialism with the teachings of the Gospel about truth and love.”7 The image of the Utopian Socialist Christ is constantly evoked in his pages; even in a poem which became “the hymn of several generations of revolutionaries,”8 the poet enjoins his comrades, condemned like himself to torture and execution, to pardon “our senseless executioners”9 with Christian forgiveness. This rebellious but self-sacrificial mood probably comes as close as we can get to Dostoevsky’s own moral-social ideal at the time.

Not only did he visit the Beketovs’ quarters, but he was also among the early members of the circle gathered around Mikhail Butashevich-Petrashevsky, whose Friday evenings also attracted Pleshcheev and were soon to become the chief rallying place for the progressive intelligentsia in Petersburg.

Art, he said, was grounded in what he called “the law of sympathy” (an idea that goes back both to Adam Smith and Hume, and anticipates as well the late nineteenth century doctrine of aesthetic empathy). According to this “law,” man knows and understands everything by comparison with himself; it is through the process of “humanization” that he absorbs the world and domesticates it to his feeling (in art) and his understanding (in science and philosophy).

“Both Gogol and Dostoevsky depict existing society,” he writes. “But Gogol is preeminently a social poet, while Dostoevsky is preeminently a psychological one. For the first, the individual is important as the representative of a certain society or a certain group; for the second, society itself is interesting because of its influence on the personality of the individual. . . . Gogol’s collected works may emphatically be called the artistic statistics of Russia. Dostoevsky also gives us a strikingly artistic depiction of Russian society, but with him this provides only the background of the picture, and is conveyed, in most instances, with such minute strokes that it is completely swallowed up by the importance of the psychological interest. Even in Poor Folk, the interest aroused by the analysis of the people that he brings on the scene is incomparably stronger than the impression created on the reader by the vivid depiction of the life surrounding them.”

“About this and this,” he cried; “about order and anarchy. There is your precious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and barren; and there is anarchy, rich, living, reproducing itself—there is anarchy, splendid in green and gold.” “All the same,” replied Syme patiently, “just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp. I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree.”

Did she not know, he mocks, that according to modern optics “what charms [her] sight does not exist in reality, but is the product of [her own] vision in which is focused the spherical convexity that [she] sees?” Belinsky is here at his most crudely and scientifically positive; and the same naive scientism is evident in his reply to what he calls “the humanistic cosmopolitans” or “the fantastic cosmopolitans” (Maikov and his friends) with their universal ideal of “humanity” and their repudiation of nationality.

But now, in replying to Maikov, Belinsky declares that “on this subject [nationality] I am rather inclined to side with the Slavophils rather than to remain on the side of the humanistic cosmopolitans.”

Indeed, much of what Belinsky says about nationality in this article turns up in the later journalism of Dostoevsky almost word for word. Like Belinsky, and in opposition to the Slavophils, Dostoevsky would always refuse to whitewash or glamorize the Russian past, and to dream of the restoration of some sort of Arcadian, pre-Petrine world; but like Belinsky again he wholeheartedly shared the Slavophil criticism of “Russian Europeanism.”

Russian nationality is thus no longer to be neglected, disparaged, or discarded; on the contrary, as the Slavophils argued, it was to become the principle on which the Russia of the future was to be founded. But this made the task of defining such a principle of Russian nationality all the more pressing and important. The Slavophils believed that Russia differed from Europe because its own history had been marked by peaceful Christian concord rather than by the egoistic struggles for power so typical of Western rivalries between classes and nations. But Belinsky disdainfully sweeps aside the idea that Russian history offers any support for the view that Russian nationality can be identified with the principle of love and humility. Even though agreeing with the Slavophils that Russia was destined to give the world “our word, our thought,” he wonders whether perhaps the time is yet ripe to try and define this Russian “word” with any clarity.

There had been, ever since the end of the eighteenth century, a line of Russian satirical writing directed against excessive Europeanization; and the vision of Russia as charged with a world-historical mission to synthesize the conflicting national cultures of Europe had been much in the air since the 1820s.

* But such ideas were given a new vitality and actuality when Belinsky used them to rebut Maikov’s “cosmopolitanism” in the 1840s. For in freeing the idea of “nationality” from the negative and limiting connotations given it by Maikov, he adroitly turned it toward a universalism that rescued patriotic emotion and national pride from the Slavophils and reconciled them with progressive Westernism. This is the same vision of Russia as the future creator of a pan-human world-culture that we shall find evoked so often and so eloquently by Dostoevsky; and it will be supported by exactly the same arguments–the ease with which Russians learn foreign languages, their ability to identify with alien cultures, the role of Russian literature as precursor of the new world-synthesis. To these, of course, Dostoevsky will add the Russian Christ as the divine warrant of moral freedom and the triumph of human liberty over the laws of nature. In such a perspective, his post-Siberian “Slavophil” ideology may thus be seen as an amalgam of ideas whose roots go back both to Belinsky and to Valerian Maikov.

It is important to sketch such lines of continuity if we are to restore the true historical picture that Dostoevsky himself did so much to blur. For the moment, though, let us note only the general tenor of Belinsky’s article. “Europe today is engrossed with great new problems . . . but . . . it would be quite futile to treat these problems as our own. . . . We ourselves, in ourselves, and around ourselves–that is where we should seek both the problems and their solutions.”

During the first flush of the success of Poor Folk, the future shone for Dostoevsky in the most resplendent colors. It was not only that he saw himself as a famous and fêted writer, all of whose boyhood dreams of glory were at last to be realized; critical success and public acclaim would also mean the end of the financial worries that had plagued him ever since his resignation from the Army. A few months after his discovery by Belinsky, he reports to Mikhail that “Kraevsky, hearing that I had no money, entreated me most humbly to borrow 500 rubles from him.”1 At the beginning of 1846, after citing some of Belinsky’s still-laudatory opinions, Dostoevsky adds jubilantly: “Brother, my future is as brilliant as it can possibly be!”2

Soon finding himself totally dependent on the editor for his sustenance, Dostoevsky was forced to turn out copy against his will to pay his debts. In a letter of October 1846, he tells Mikhail of his desire to go to Italy so as to write a novel there at leisure and in freedom -to write “for myself, and so make it possible to raise my price. And the system of eternal debt, which Kraevsky tries to extend to everybody, is the system of my slavery and literary vassalage.”

This passage is a superb illustration of Belinsky’s point that a feuilletonist could “definitely manage to express everything” in the midst of what seems like inconsequential chatter. For Dostoevsky here is pointing his finger at the greatest moral-social blight on Russian society, and scornfully condemning those who nonetheless continue, with an untroubled conscience, to lead their dignified, civilized, self-satisfied lives. The juxtaposition of the fancy-dress ball with the peasant “revelers” speaks for itself; so does the “anguish and misgiving” that gnaw at the heart of the chronicler, and the “melancholy” that overcomes him while attending the festive gatherings of polite society. For the “reality” of Russian life is to be found, not in the social rituals of the ruling strata, but in the suffering and heartbreak of the enslaved peasantry.

Waxing merry over this search by the foreign visitor for visible signs of the Russian soul, the chronicler ridicules his dislike of droshkys “because they diverge from the old, patriarchal wagonette, thus testifying to the manner in which everything indigenous and national in Russia disappears.” But the chronicler’s target turns out to be, not so much the visiting tourist himself, as those in Russia who adopt a similar point of view. For, he notes, such ideas “coincide with some–we shall not say Russian–but idle ideas of our own, conceived in the study.” This is of course an allusion to the Slavophils, who are also delineated as those who search for Russian nationality in “a dead letter, an outworn idea, a heap of stones [the Kremlin] presumably recalling ancient Rus, and, finally, in a blind unconditional reversion to a slumbering native antiquity.”

Still, in 1847 Dostoevsky differs sharply from the later view he expressed of the relation between the people and the educated class. As we have just seen, Dostoevsky desired nothing more fervently than the liberation of the serfs and was deeply troubled by the suffering of the people. But, for all his nationalism, he had not yet accepted the Slavophil view of the Russian people as endowed with any extraordinary moral qualities and virtues. “What are the people?” asks the chronicler. “The people are ignorant and uneducated,” and they look for leadership “to society, to the educated class” (XIII: 23). This is exactly the reverse of what Dostoevsky would say after Siberia, when he advised the educated class to look for guidance to the people. It is thus the intelligentsia who must lead the people along the path hewn out, with a giant hand, by Peter the Great, to the fulfillment of “his great idea.”

Such a revaluation of egoism, as we have noted earlier, was very much in the foreground of Russian awareness in 1847; the combined influence of Fourier and Max Stirner had been working to transform this idea from the negative to the positive. It was in the summer of this year that Belinsky felt called upon to mull over the lessons of Stirner; and Herzen-whom Dostoevsky was reading with envy and admiration*–had published his own conclusions a few months before Dostoevsky’s feuilleton. “To eradicate egoism from a man’s breast,” Herzen wrote, “means to eradicate his vital principle, his leaven, the salt of his personality ... I dare say that a rational acknowledgment of self-will is the highest moral acknowledgment of human dignity and that all can aspire to it.”

As late as 1873, Dostoevsky advised a young woman writer, aspiring to educate herself, to obtain old issues of Notes of the Fatherland from the public library and read what Herzen had published in the mid- and late-1840s. He refers specifically to Herzen’s Letters on the Study of Nature (1845-1846), which he calls “the best philosophy” not only to have appeared in Russia, but also in Europe.

   Herzen’s Letters are a lively résumé of Hegel’s History of Philosophy, written from a Left Hegelian point of view but still idealist in character. Eighteenth century materialism is rejected by Herzen, as it was by Hegel, because it is solely a philosophy of “negation,” DVS, 2: 138; see also Dimitri Chizevsky [Tschižewskij], “Hegel in Russland,” in Hegel bei den Slaven, ed.

“Naturalism” is defined approvingly in the Pocket Dictionary as a modern philosophy which, considering “divinity nothing other than the general and higher function of human thought,” has led to “anthropotheism”–the recognition that all positive religions based on revelation or tradition are really man’s deification of himself or of the laws of nature.4 In a letter, Petrashevsky refers sarcastically to Christ as “the well-known demagogue, whose career finished rather unsuccessfully.”5 And like a good Left Hegelian, he believed that religion was not only an error but positively harmful: having robbed man of his highest attributes by making them supernatural, it condemned humankind to inactivity and stagnation and stood in the path of progress.

Despite his wide range of acquaintances, which he made such strenuous efforts to extend, Petrashevsky as a man had no close friends. Always courteous and well-mannered with members of his circle, there was yet something angular and grating about his personality which perhaps sprang from the firmness of his convictions, and his self-appointed role as an intellectual agent provocateur. D. D. Akhsharumov, who later became a doctor and a pioneer in Russian social hygiene, says that “he spoke in a low and mild voice. His conversation was always serious, often in a scoffing tone: his look expressed, above all, thoughtfulness, contempt, and a biting derision.”7 Petrashevsky was respected for his wide erudition, his staunchness of character, and the inexhaustible energy he displayed in carrying out his mission as an apostle of social discontent; but he rarely inspired any feelings of cordiality or affection. Dostoevsky, under questioning, denied any real intimacy with him but felt obliged to add: “To be sure, I always respected [him] as an honorable and noble human being.”8 This attitude was more or less typical.

D. D.

Sometimes one of the specialists would give a report in the form of a lecture. . . . Because of the content of the conversations touching primarily on social-political questions, these Petrashevsky evenings interested us enormously; they were the only ones of their kind in Petersburg. The gatherings usually continued far into the night, until two or three in the morning, and ended with a modest supper.”

Both of these had been small and tightly knit groups bound together by ties of personal friendship and common aims and interests. At Petrashevsky’s, there was only a more or less haphazard conglomeration of people whose membership constantly fluctuated, and who had little or no underlying bond of unity except curiosity and the desire freely to speak their mind. Moreover, there were other and more particular reasons why this circle would not have attracted Dostoevsky irresistibly week after week. Even though externally Dostoevsky and Petrashevsky remained on the best of terms-and Petrashevsky, from time to time, paid a call on the young writer who was the most famous catch he had succeeded in hauling in–the two did not get on very well together. Dostoevsky writes in his deposition that both of them “took care not to carry on a conversation with each other for very long because we would have begun to fight after ten words, and this annoyed both of us.”

In the first place, Dostoevsky would certainly have disliked Petrashevsky’s rampant Left Hegelian atheism as much as he had disliked that of Belinsky; as a matter of fact, we can imagine him disliking it a good deal more. Belinsky’s tempestuous explosions were at least indicative of a genuine emotional concern for the dilemmas of religious faith; and the warmth and good-heartedness of his character, as well as his genius as a critic, no doubt made up for a good deal. Petrashevsky was of an entirely different temperament, and always spoke of religion with coldly hostile sarcasm or scornfully mocking irreverence. After Dostoevsky’s death, Nikolay Speshnev-about whom we shall soon be hearing a good deal-told Mme Dostoevsky that “Petrashevsky had produced a repulsive impression on [Dostoevsky] because he was an atheist and mocked at faith.”

“I met F. M. Dostoevsky in the winter of 1848. That was a difficult period for the educated youth. From the first day of the February revolution, the most incredible events succeeded one another in Europe. The unheard-of reforms of Pius IX provoked uprisings in Milan, Venice, Naples; the surge of liberal ideas in Germany provoked revolutions in Berlin and Vienna. It seemed as if some general rebirth was on the way for the entire European world. The rotten foundations of the old reaction were falling, and a new life was beginning for all of Europe. But, at the same time, the most oppressive stagnation reigned in Russia; thought and the press were confined more and more, and no activity appeared anywhere since social life had been crushed. . . . Practically with every mail delivery from abroad, we heard about new rights granted to the people, whether willingly or not, while in Russian society we heard only rumors of more limitations and constraints. Whoever remembers that period knows how all this worked on the minds of the youthful intelligentsia.”

Deciding to investigate him a little more carefully, both the secret police and the Ministry of Internal Affairs placed him under secret surveillance. To avoid confusion the job was finally assigned to the Ministry, whose agents reported, after ten months, that meetings were taking place in his home every Friday lasting until three or four in the morning. “They [the guests] did not play cards, but instead read, spoke, and disputed; but what exactly they spoke about it was impossible to determine because of the caution and secrecy with which Petrashevsky surrounded himself.”22 Accordingly, a secret agent named Antonelli-an ex-student, and the son of a well-known painter of Italian descent–turned up as a fellow employee of Petrashevsky at the Ministry in January 1849. Antonelli furnished his superiors with regular reports of his conversations with the suspect; and though Petrashevsky was suspicious of his efforts to ingratiate himself, and wondered about his liberal supply of funds, Antonelli was present at the last seven meetings of the circle between March 11 and April 22.

The information regarding Dostoevsky’s participation in the debates of the Petrashevsky circle is quite scanty. As he told the investigating commission, “I am far from being a loudmouth, and everybody who knows me will say the same. I do not like to speak noisily and lengthily even with friends, of whom I have a very few, and still more in society, where I have the reputation of being an uncommunicative, reserved, unsociable person.”

Denying to the investigating commission that he had ever held forth at Petrashevsky’s about social or political matters, Dostoevsky does admit that he took the floor on other subjects. “I spoke at his place only three times, or better, twice. Once about literature, on the occasion of a dispute with Petrashevsky about Krylov, and the other time about personality and egoism.”24 The argument about literature arose because of Petrashevsky’s already mentioned attack on fables. Dostoevsky explains his own position as having been “that art has no necessity to have a tendency, that art is an end in itself, that an author should concern himself only over artistic quality and the idea will come by itself; for this is a necessary condition of artistic quality. In a word, it is well known that this is a tendency diametrically opposed to the journalistic and inflammatory.”25 These words are very similar to those already quoted* in which Dostoevsky explains his break with Belinsky as having been caused by disagreements over the role of literature in society.

“Socialism offers a thousand methods of social organization,” he comments, “and since all these books are written intelligently, fervently, and often with genuine love for mankind, I read them with curiosity. But precisely because I do not adhere to any of the social systems, I studied Socialism in general, all of its systems, and this is why (though my knowledge is far from complete) I see the faults in every social system.

Milyutin saw Socialist theories as inspired by an admirably humanitarian aim; but like Maikov he found it impossible to accept any of their concrete proposals. Concerned, like Maikov again–and also like Dostoevsky–with the freedom of the individual, Milyutin criticized the “new schools” for limiting this freedom much too drastically. “In those forms of social organization worked out by the new schools,” he writes, “the personality of the individual either vanishes entirely, or is contained within the most confining limits. Instead of finding the means of reconciling the two equally necessary principles of individualism and sociality (obshchinnost), contemporary schools, for the most part, sacrifice the first in the interests of the second, and subordinate the activity of the individual to certain rules that cannot be complied with except through self-restraint or self-sacrifice.”

As P. N. Sakulin has pointed out, exactly the same idea and terminology is used more concisely in Dostoevsky’s deposition. “Socialism is a science in ferment,” he explains to his judges, “a chaos, alchemy rather than chemistry, astrology rather than astronomy. It seems to me, however, that out of the present chaos something consistent, logical, and beneficial will be worked out for the common good.”

Among these latter was F. M. Dostoevsky. He read the Socialist writers, but regarded them critically. Agreeing that at the foundation of their doctrines there was a noble aim, he nonetheless considered them only as estimable visionaries.”

A crucial catalyst in this development of Populist ideas was the book of the German agronomist Baron Haxthausen, Studies on the Interior of Russia (1847), which depicted the Russian peasant commune as remarkably similar “to the utopia which modern political sects, namely, the Saint-Simonians and the communists, have imagined to represent the perfect society.”

Ideas very close to these proto-Populist formulations can be found in Dostoevsky’s deposition. “Fourierism, and along with it every Western system, is so unsuited for our soil, so strange to our conditions, so not in the character of our nation-and, on the other hand, so much an outgrowth of the West, so much a product of the Western order of things, where the proletarian question has to be solved by any means whatever . . . [that] for us now, among whom there is no proletariat, it would be killingly ridiculous.”43 Since Dostoevsky had recently insisted on the impossibility of understanding Russian history and national character in European terms, the appeal of such “Slavophil” ideas, freed from the onus of their suspect origin by Haxthausen’s approval, would clearly have been very powerful.

Clearly, Dostoevsky spoke with uncontrollable fervor at such moments, whether at Petrashevsky’s or elsewhere. “I cannot now give his speeches exactly,” writes Milyukov, “but I remember very well that he always spoke energetically against all measures that would hamstring the people in any way, and he was particularly outraged at the mistreatment from which both the lowest class and the youth in school suffered.”46 What swept over him was no doubt a combination of all the old emotions connected with his traumatic experience of the beating of the peasant coachman on the road to Petersburg; his memory of the routine sadism at the Academy of Engineers; and the nightmare images and suffocating sense of complicity arising from guilt over his father’s death.

It was perhaps Dostoevsky’s volcanic eruptiveness, whenever he came to speak about serfdom, that may have first brought him to the attention of the enigmatic and fascinating figure of Nikolay Speshnev. For within the amorphous agglomeration of the Petrashevsky circle, the iron-willed Speshnev was one of the few ruthlessly determined to turn words into deeds; and he was continually on the watch for people he might recruit for this purpose. He formed a little circle–partly among the Petrashevtsy, partly through his own contacts–which was the only true secret society to emerge from the Petrashevsky “Fridays.” Very little is known for certain about this underground organization, but one fact is incontestable: Dostoevsky was among its members. Not Belinsky or Petrashevsky but Speshnev was Dostoevsky’s mentor in revolutionary radicalism; it was Speshnev who shaped Dostoevsky’s conception of what underground conspiracy really meant in practice. The relations between the two, so far as they can be unraveled, thus deserve to be treated in some detail.

Speshnev, moreover, was not only different from the others because of his wealth and social status; he was also an extraordinary person in his own right. Bakunin–a product of the same milieu, and who knew a fellow aristocrat when he saw one–was much impressed with Speshnev when they met in Siberia in 1860. “Speshnev,” he wrote to Herzen, “is a remarkable man in many ways: intelligent, cultivated, handsome, aristocratic in bearing, not at all standoffish though quietly cold, inspiring confidence–like every one possessing a quiet strength-a gentleman from head to foot.”

Unlike Belinsky, however, Speshnev seems never to have been strongly influenced by the sentimental humanitarianism and the religious-philosophical Messianism of the Sand-Leroux school. He was much more attracted by the doctrines rampant among the extreme French secret societies that preached the necessity of violence, and whose Communism was combined with a philosophy of materialism, atheism, and Utilitarian self-interest rather than with an updated version of Christianity.

There is also very good reason to believe that Speshnev, during his sojourn in Paris, was influenced by the fathers of Marxism themselves (not yet Marxists, to be sure). In the fall of 1844, Engels wrote a letter to the New Moral World, an Owenite-Communist journal, proudly claiming that “we are having much success among the Russians living in Paris. There are three or four Russian nobles and land-owners here who are declared radical Communists and atheists.” V. I. Semevsky, writing before the Russian Revolution, and a historian of scrupulous objectivity with an unrivaled knowledge of Russian radicalism, thinks “we can scarcely doubt that one of these Russians was Speshnev.”

Nonetheless, Speshnev makes a careful distinction between such long-range irreconcilabilities–which presumably can be eliminated only by force–and a temporary union of differing factions to achieve a limited goal on which they all concur. Just imagine, he tells Chojecki, that there are believing Christians and dyed-in-the-wool atheists who both agree that private property is evil, and that earthly goods should be distributed according to need. Even if they differ about ultimate aims, “why should [they] not agree on the establishment of a communal organization of society as long as both value this? . . . You think that all the Byzantine metaphysics in my head can only cause trouble? Fine, but what stops you from condemning it after we accomplish what we have both been striving for?” And Speshnev assures Chojecki that, unless one adopts such a course, “your party will rightly consider you to be a very unpractical fellow.”9 This ironic advocacy of political Machiavellianism helps to light up some of the shadowy background of Speshnev’s machinations in the Petrashevsky circle.

What Speshnev says about philosophy in these letters further illuminates his personality and jibes perfectly with his tactical opportunism. A good deal of space is devoted to refuting the views of a Polish Left Hegelian named Kamieński, whose book Speshnev compares with Proudhon’s Système des contradictions économiques; but the most important remarks are those that show how strongly he had come under the influence of Max Stirner. Rejecting all attempts to establish any sort of metaphysical system, Speshnev writes: “Anthropotheism [the position of Feuerbach] is also a religion, only a different one. It divinizes a new and different object, but there is nothing new about the fact of divinization. ... Is the difference between a God-man and a Man-god really so great?” Both, he says, are abstractions, which do not concern the actually existing individual of flesh-and-blood. “Am I, writing to you now, really identical with humanity or ‘the human’? ... If not, then ‘humanity’ and ‘the human’ are also alien, foreign beings, not identical with me, and, though rather similar, still alien authorities.” Accordingly, Speshnev concludes that “such categories as beauty and ugliness, good and bad, noble and base, always were and always will remain a matter of taste.”

Speshnev was of a totally different moral temper than Petrashevsky, and the two men were, ideologically, poles apart. Both were revolutionaries in the sense that both wanted fundamental social changes in Russia. But Petrashevsky pinned his hopes to a gradual, long-range evolution, decried precipitous political action, and rejected egalitarian Communism as economic barbarism. Speshnev openly called himself a Communist, believed in the nationalization of all means of production in the hands of a strong central power, and felt that the initial and most important step should be the seizure of such power by the revolutionaries at the first favorable opportunity.

Mombelli, as we now know, was a member of Speshnev’s secret organization, and his suggestion may have been part of a more elaborate plan. Speshnev, in any case, immediately seized the opportunity to outline his own idea of what a secret society should be. He explained that “there are three illegal methods of action–Jesuitical [i.e., infiltration], propaganda, and revolt; that neither of these is certain, and thus there is a better chance if all three roads are taken, and for this a central committee [is] necessary whose function would be to form auxiliary ones: a committee of brotherhood to set up a school of Fourierist, Communist, and Liberal propaganda, and, finally, a committee to form, behind all this, a secret society for revolt.”

Mombelli suggested that all members of the proposed organization begin by writing their biography (perhaps for purposes of pressure and blackmail?), and that traitors were to be executed. But Petrashevsky engaged in delaying tactics, constantly warned about the necessity for being prudent and practical, and said that, even though he did not approve of violent revolution, he still believed he would live in a phalanstery during his lifetime. Speshnev finally lost patience, refused to attend any more such futile meetings, and broke off relations with Petrashevsky temporarily sometime in December 1848.

This attempt to enlist Maikov was first revealed in a letter written after Dostoevsky’s death (but never sent) and published only in 1922; it contains the names of Speshnev and Pavel Filippov as two other members of this secret group (Filippov was an ex-student at the University of St. Petersburg whom Dostoevsky listed, along with Golovinsky, as among his closest friends). Maikov told the same story verbally to a friend, a minor poet, who transcribed it in a diary that came to light in 1956. Here we learn the names of all the other members: Nikolay Mordvinov, Mombelli, Nikolay Grigoryev, Vladimir Milyutin; and the purpose of the organization is bluntly stated to be that of “producing a revolution in Russia.”

In his letter, Maikov also mentions having learned later that the parts for a handpress had been gathered together and assembled shortly before the arrest of all the Petrashevtsy. The activities of this underground group, so far as they are known, will be detailed in the next chapter. What is important here is simply to establish that Dostoevsky was a member of such an organization beginning at least in January, and that he had accepted the responsibility of actively recruiting on its behalf.

Nothing further has been unearthed for certain about this Speshnev fraction, although its existence was not a secret from the more penetrating observers who came to Petrashevsky’s. D. D. Akhsharumov remarks, in his memoirs, that Speshnev had formed “his own circle, with, so far as I know, its own tendency, as it were competing with Petrashevsky.”19 What this tendency was may be gathered from Speshnev’s testimony about his social-political ideas. “When he [Speshnev] heard in 1848 that this question [the liberation of the serfs] had been put aside, it seemed to him that to postpone this question meant voluntarily to prepare in Russia the sole possible aim of a peasant insurrection.”

Many years later, Dostoevsky gave some additional information to his close friend and official biographer, Orest Miller. “For Feodor Mikhailovich himself,” Miller writes, “the memory evidently remained that a conspiracy in intent had existed-that is, existed for the future. It sprang, evidently, from the general discontent, which was the most important link between the members of ‘the society for propaganda’ as it was accurately named in the Leipzig book.† The aim was to spread discontent with the existing order everywhere, beginning with the schools: to establish connections with everybody who was already discontented–with the religious dissidents (raskolniki) and the peasant serfs.”

Dr. Yanovsky became aware of a notable change in the character of his friend Feodor Dostoevsky between the end of 1848 and the time of his arrest three months later. “He became somewhat melancholy,” he writes, “more irritable, more touchy, ready to quarrel over the merest trifle, and very often complained of giddiness.” Yanovsky reassured his patient that there was no organic cause for these symptoms, and predicted that his gloomy state of mind would probably soon pass away. To which Dostoevsky replied: “No, it will not, and it will torture me for a long time. For I have taken money from Speshnev (he named a sum of about five hundred rubles) and now I am with him and his. I’ll never be able to pay back such a sum, yes, and he wouldn’t take the money back; that’s the kind of man he is.” And Dostoevsky repeated several times, so that the sentence engraved itself in Yanovsky’s memory: “Do you understand, from now on I have a Mephistopheles of my own!”

Just what Dostoevsky was feeling and thinking in these last few months of his freedom is difficult to determine with any certainty: the evidence is all inferential and quite contradictory. It is clear from Maikov’s account, and from everything else we know, that Dostoevsky–passionately committed to the aim of liberating the serfs–had agreed to cooperate with Speshnev in his secret society. On at least one occasion, according to an eyewitness, when the question arose of what action to take if it proved impossible to free the serfs except through an uprising, “Dostoevsky, with his usual impressionability, exclaimed: ‘And so let there be an uprising!’”25 On the other hand, Milyukov recalls another debate over the perennial question of whether the people would be freed “from above” or “from below.” Dostoevsky, according to this source, was among those who said that “our people would not follow in the traces of European revolutionaries, and, not believing in a new Pugachev revolt, will patiently await the resolution of their fate by the supreme power.”

This is all the more likely because, throughout these months, the risks and dangers of the enterprise must have begun to assail him once the first flare-up of the moment of decision had passed. The warnings of disaster given by Maikov in their nighttime conversation possibly began to sink in. Even long before this conversation, there is evidence that Dostoevsky had been continually anxious over the perils of his Petrashevsky involvement. It was he who first voiced the suspicion that Chernosvitov was probably a police spy; and he became increasingly uneasy about the unknowns who crowded into Petrashevsky’s flat week after week. Haunted by the possibility of betrayal and arrest even for assisting at these relatively innocent Petrashevsky gatherings, whose toleration by the authorities for so long seemed to guarantee a certain security, how much more would he have been agitated, how much more a prey to extreme fluctuations of emotion, because of his relations with the Speshnev group!

One day, Yanovsky overheard a quarrel in which Mikhail, now a dedicated Fourierist, told his brother firmly that he hewed to the line of this non-political credo. Dostoevsky urged him to read a book by Louis Blanc, and assured him that, if he did so, he would change his mind.27 Since Louis Blanc was the great Socialist advocate of the use of state power to implement social change, one can deduce that the controversy had arisen over Dostoevsky’s conversion to political activism under the influence of Speshnev. Writing years later of his brother in Diary of a Writer, and praising him for not having given anyone away during his incarceration (Mikhail was arrested, but released after two months), Dostoevsky stated that “although he took no part in anything, he did know many things”28 The italics can be taken to imply that he had been made privy to the existence and the plans of the Speshnev group; and if so, Dostoevsky would have been constantly assailed, not only by his own misgivings, but by Mikhail’s arguments and presages of disaster as well.

After all, Dostoevsky had been in debt often before (he was, as a matter of fact, rarely out of debt), and the indebtedness itself would not have agitated him so strongly. What disturbed him was the extra tie of personal obligation to Speshnev that the debt fastened on him, and which reduced the margin of inner freedom he would have liked to preserve. In this sense, Dostoevsky’s explanation was by no means false–he indicated both the person and the event at the root of the trouble; but he could not of course reveal his conspiratorial commitment to the innocent doctor, whom he had refused even to take to Petrashevsky’s.

The Petrashevsky circle split into two main factions. One, the Kashkin circle, was composed of pure Fourierists who felt that too little time was spent in discussing and explaining the doctrines of the Master. It was they who arranged the famous banquet in honor of Fourier’s birthday on April 7, 1849, and invited Petrashevsky to be one of the speakers. Dostoevsky, not a Fourierist, was neither asked to join this circle nor invited to the banquet. He belonged to another group–the Palm-Durov circle–composed of people whose interest in Fourier was minimal, and who, indeed, felt that there was already far too much discussion of his ideas at the regular Petrashevsky sessions.

When the Dostoevsky brothers, as well as Danilevsky and Butkov, complained bitterly about the rigors of the censorship, Speshnev offered to arrange to have any works they wished to give him published abroad (probably through Chojecki, who intended to establish a Russian Free Press in the West). Mikhail Dostoevsky, however, flatly refused the proposition, and the others were confused and hesitant. This is by no means the only time we shall see Mikhail taking a firm public stand against outright illegality, while his brother remained in the background and, by his silence, at least implied consent and approval.

Palm wrote in his deposition that the people who formed this group (including the two Dostoevskys) “discussing the evenings at Petrashevsky . . . and finding that they were sometimes tedious and monotonous because of the speeches, had the idea of organizing evenings devoted exclusively to music and literature. When Mombelli asked whether Petrashevsky would be invited, Durov said: ‘Petrashevsky, like a bull, sticks to philosophy and politics; he has no understanding of fine art and will only spoil our evenings.’”

There is, however, another version of the origin of the circle that comes from Speshnev. He told the investigators that Dostoevsky and Pleshcheev once paid him a visit “and said that they wished to meet with their acquaintances in some place other than Petrashevsky’s, where it was boring, and one spoke only about learned subjects and one hardly knew the people, so that it was dangerous to utter a word; that they would invite only those among their acquaintances who they were sure were not spies, and that he, Speshnev, could do the same. This society he [Speshnev] could only label as one formed because of fear of the police.”

Even if the meetings had really been meant to be as free of politics as was claimed, it is clear that the literary tastes of the participants allowed for no such exclusion. And, in fact, talk about the liberation of the serfs and the tyranny of the censorship flowed as freely there as at Petrashevsky’s. Moreover, one incident at this very first meeting is highly significant. Mombelli, a member of the Speshnev society, told the circle that its reunions would unquestionably be considered those of a social-political “club,” whatever the participants may have intended. Hence, he suggested, they might as well form a mutual-assistance society–presumably the same kind of organization that he had discussed a few months previous during the secret negotiations with Petrashevsky. This early attempt to introduce an overtly political note, however, was not well received. Mombelli ran into severe resistance from those attracted to the group because of its literary-musical character and, though he did not insist, for several weeks afterwards he was not present at the Palm-Durov reunions.

The next important event in the history of the circle occurred approximately three or four weeks later, sometime toward the end of March. Pavel Filippov, another Speshnevite, suggested that it was time for the members of the group, now that they had come to know each other so well, to think of sharing their social-political ideas with others. He proposed that “they undertake, as a united effort, the composition of articles in a spirit of liberalism [which meant “revolutionary” in those days] concerning questions that touch on the contemporary condition of Russia, in a juridical and administrative sense.” It was necessary, Filippov explained, to strip bare “all the injustice of the laws . . . [and] all the corruption and deficiencies in the organization of our administration.”6 Once such articles had been written, they could be reproduced on a home lithograph and distributed. Another member of the circle, F. N. Lvov, was a staff captain in the Army who taught chemistry at a school for cadets. He declared himself willing and able to set up an apparatus of this kind, and promised to make an estimate of the costs.

The commission, it is relevant to note, distinguished very sharply between the two brothers and was not impressed by Dostoevsky’s speech against the lithograph. Mikhail was freed two months after the investigation began, and was even indemnified for his loss of income.* Feodor was sentenced for, among other reasons, “the attempt, along with others, to write works against the government and circulate them by means of a home lithograph.”

A manuscript by Filippov–which never saw the light, but was found among his papers–is exactly of the same character: a new, revolutionary version of the Ten Commandments, written in a combination of Church Slavonic and modern Russian. Each commandment is interpreted in a manner to persuade the reader (or listener) that a revolt against oppression and social injustice is in conformity with the will of God. The authorities were particularly disturbed by Filippov’s comments on the sixth commandment, which “said that if peasants kill their master, they are obeying the will of God; that whoever goes to war is sinful, and the Tsar in particular sins when he leads his people to commit murder.”

If uttered, however, the words are of great interest because they coincide with an inner evolution observable–as we shall see in later chapters–both in The Landlady and, more emphatically, in Netotchka Nezvanova. Both these works show Dostoevsky shifting some of the onus for unhappiness and human misery to the moral failures or weaknesses of individuals themselves, and thus removing it from society; to this extent one may see here the first intimations of the doctrine of self-purification. There is no evidence, however, that at this time Dostoevsky was undergoing any social-political change of heart, or that his commitment to the aims of the Speshnev group was in any way faltering. No hint of repentance or remorse shows up in his deposition, although many other defendants did blame themselves and beat their breasts in humiliating contrition.

Antonelli, who arrived a bit late, reports on a dispute between Durov and Filippov already in progress. The issue at stake involved the technique of propaganda. Should one attack the laws and the Tsar directly, or try to arouse enmity only against the lower officials with whom the people were in actual contact? Durov was in favor of attacking the source of evil directly because the lower officials were themselves oppressed and should not be made to bear the brunt of the blame.

This may explain why, at the meeting of April 1, he launched a full-scale attack against the hotheads dreaming of the possibility of a putsch. Petrashevsky began by outlining three problems as being of paramount social-political importance. These were, he said, the abolition of censorship, the reform of the judicial system, and the liberation of the serfs. How should they be rated in urgency? Which one should receive the priority of the efforts of those working for progress? Petrashevsky’s answer, which he developed with great ingenuity, was that the reform of the judicial system should be ranked as the first and most pressing goal. So far as the censorship was concerned, Petrashevsky expressed sympathy for those who had to struggle with its tentacles; but he refused to regard it only negatively. In his view, it did some good by eliminating stupidities and absurdities and compelling writers to watch over what they said very carefully.

April 22, the date of the last meeting at Petrashevsky’s, was a day of pouring rain, and at about six o’clock Dostoevsky stopped in at Dr. Yanovsky’s to dry off and drink a glass of tea. Yanovsky assumed that Dostoevsky was going to Petrashevsky’s, and nothing was said that gave him any other impression. Dostoevsky even borrowed money for a cab because of the considerable distance between where Yanovsky lived and Petrashevsky’s home. Either Yanovsky’s memory played him false in this instance, or Dostoevsky was deliberately concealing his destination. For he spent the evening at Grigoryev’s, perhaps talking over plans with him and others for the operation of the handpress. At four in the morning he returned home and went to bed; but shortly thereafter was awakened by a faint metallic sound in the room. Opening his eyes sleepily, he saw standing before him the local police official of his quarter, sporting a pair of luxurious sideburns, and a lieutenant-colonel dressed in the light blue uniform of the secret police whose dangling sword was clinking against his boots. Told very politely by the officer to rise and dress, he did so while his room was searched and his papers sealed. A much-rubbed fifteen copek piece on his table attracted attention; and when Dostoevsky jestingly inquired whether it was counterfeit, it was solemnly added to the evidence. A sergeant was ordered to inspect the shelf above the stove and climbed on a table; but he fell down heavily as the cornice of the shelf gave way, and the search was given up. Finally, Dostoevsky was conducted to a waiting carriage, accompanied by the local police official, the lieutenant-colonel, his frightened landlady, and her servant Ivan, who was also frightened but “looked around with an air of stupid solemnity appropriate to the occasion.”32 When Dostoevsky left the room and entered the carriage, he stepped out of the relatively normal life he had been living up to that time–with the exception of his brief apprenticeship as an underground conspirator–and into an extraordinary new world. This new world would strain Dostoevsky’s emotional and spiritual capacities to the utmost, and immeasurably widen the range of his moral and psychological experience. What he had only read about previously in the most extravagant creations of the Romantics, whether metaphysical or social, would now become for him the very flesh and blood of his existence. He would know the creeping and chilling despair of total solitude in prison; he would feel the desperate anguish of the hunted; he would live through the terrifying agony of the condemned clinging desperately to the last precious moments of life; he would sink to the lowest depths of society, rub elbows with outcasts and criminals, and listen to the talk of sadists and murderers for whom the very notion of morality was a farce; and he would have instants of sublime inner harmony, moments of fusion with the divine principle ruling the universe, in the ecstatic “aura” preceding an epileptic attack. When he returns to society again and begins to rediscover himself as a writer, the horizon of his creations will now be defined by this new world and its overwhelming revelations. And this will enable him to create works of incomparably more profound imaginative scope than had been possible in the 1840s, when his only approach to such a world had been through its Romantic stereotypes.

The first several chapters of The Double give a brilliant picture of Golyadkin’s split personality before it has disintegrated entirely into two independent entities. On the one hand, there is Golyadkin’s evident desire to pretend to a higher social station and a more flattering image of himself-hence the carriage, the livery, the simulated shopping spree for elegant furniture as if he were a new bridegroom, even the marvelous detail of changing his banknotes into smaller denominations to have a fatter pocketbook. His pretension to the favors of Klara Olsufyevna is only an expression of this urge for upward mobility and ego-gratification, not its cause. Indeed, the novel originally contained a passage that explicitly motivates Golyadkin as indulging in ego-enhancing daydreams. Mr. Golyadkin, Dostoevsky wrote, “very much loved occasionally to make certain romantic assumptions touching his person; he liked to promote himself now and then into the hero of the most ingenious novel, to imagine himself entangled in various intrigues and difficulties, and, at last, to emerge with honor from all the unpleasantnesses, triumphing over all obstacles, vanquishing difficulties and magnanimously forgiving his enemies”

His reaction to this event releases the psychic mechanism–the same one we have already seen in Devushkin–that will soon lead to the appearance of the double. “ ‘Bow or not? Call back or not? Recognize him or not,’ our hero wondered in indescribable anguish. ‘Or pretend that I am not myself, but somebody else strikingly like me, and look as though nothing were the matter. Simply not I, not I–and that’s all’ ” (1: 113). Golyadkin is pathetically unable to live up to the part he is trying to play, and can only escape from it by this evasion of responsibility; but the moment Andrey Filippovich disappears, the all-conquering hero comes to the surface again. “Then, suddenly recalling how taken aback he had been, our hero flushed as hot as fire, frowned, and cast a terrible defiant glance at the front corner of the carriage, a glance calculated to reduce all his foes to ashes”

In fighting off the double, Golyadkin is really fighting off his own impulses to subvert the values presumably shared by his official superiors. This is probably what Valerian Maikov meant when he said that Golyadkin perishes “from the consciousness of the disparity of particular interests in a well-ordered society,” i.e., his realization of the impossibility of asserting himself as an individual without violating the morality that has been bred into his bones and which keeps him in submission.

Such an analysis contains exactly the same mixture of sympathy and critical reserve that he incorporates in The Double: there is commiseration for Golyadkin’s desire to rise, but also a certain disdain for his inability to sustain the combat and for the paltriness of his aims.

As a result, Dostoevsky’s work of this period often contains a puzzling ambiguity of tone because a character is shown simultaneously both as socially oppressed and yet as reprehensible and morally unsavory because he has surrendered too abjectly to the pressure of his environment.

This judgment set the pattern for a view of Dostoevsky’s early work (and for much of his later work as well) that dominated a good deal of Russian criticism until the end of the nineteenth century. In 1849 P. V. Annenkov, echoing Belinsky, accused Dostoevsky of being the leader of a new literary school (which included his brother Mikhail Dostoevsky and Butkov) specializing in the portrayal of “madness for the sake of madness.”16 Annenkov severely criticized this unhealthy taste (as he saw it) for rather sensational and grotesque tragicomedy, in which he could discern no more serious or elevated artistic aim. Such an accusation was of course unfair to Dostoevsky, whose “abnormal” and “pathological” characters can all be seen, on closer examination, to make a social-cultural point. But Dostoevsky perhaps relied too much on the reader to grasp the ideological implications of his psychology, and to understand that the “abnormalities” of his characters derived from the pressure of the Russian social situation on personality. The result was an artistic lack of balance that led to a good deal of misunderstanding, and has caused unceasing critical disagreement.

This then is the demythologizing of the man-month. The number of months of a project depends upon its sequential constraints. The maximum number of men depends upon the number of independent subtasks. From these two quantities one can derive schedules using fewer men and more months. (The only risk is product obsolescence.) One cannot, however, get workable schedules using more men and fewer months. More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.

It is not difficult to understand, though, why Dostoevsky thought the “idea” embodied in The Double to have been of such importance. Golyadkin’s double represents the suppressed aspects of his personality that he is unwilling to face; and this internal split between self-image and truth-between what a person wishes to believe about himself, and what he really is–is Dostoevsky’s first grasp of a character-type that became his hallmark as a writer.

Bakhtin has perceptively remarked that Dostoevsky’s dialogues are never between two people totally alien or closed off from each other. “Dostoevsky always introduces two characters in such a way that each of them is intimately connected with the interior voice of the other. . . . The profound essential bond, or, to express it otherwise, the partial coincidence of one character’s word with the interior secret word of the other is an indispensable element in all of Dostoevsky’s most important dialogues.’’

Russian fiction of the 1830s, strongly influenced by Hoffmann and German Romanticism, is filled with the dissonance between the ideal and the real, the spiritual and the material. N. A. Polevoy, who contributed importantly to this mode, explained his artistic aim as being “to show that the mad dreams of the poets do not fit in with the world of material existence.”2 In those days, this lack of adjustment was felt to be a crushing indictment of the narrowness and limitations of the quotidian. And since it was only artists (and philosophers) who, according to the metaphysics of Romantic Idealism, were in inspired contact with the realm of transcendental truth, artists invariably turned up as the heroes of such creations. The classic expression of this theme in Russian literature is Gogol’s Nevsky Prospect.

Gogol’s story stands at the borderline between the purely Romantic delineation of this clash between the ideal and the real and its later development in the 1840s. For while Piskarev is still a positive figure compared to Pirogov, Gogol does not weight the values of the story heavily in his favor; there is something pathetic and pitiful, rather than sublimely tragic, about his ignorance of the ways of the world.

Only a short step separates this portrayal of the artist-”dreamer” from Dostoevsky’s own portrait of the type in his Petersburg feuilletons. And in the interval between the two had come Belinsky’s attack on Romanticism in the mid-1840s, which led to a complete reversal of the original Romantic relation between the ideal and the real. Now the dreamer (no longer a true artist, but an abortive or inauthentic one) becomes a symbol of the failure to grapple with and master the demands and challenges of life.

What Dostoevsky seems to be suggesting here is the opposition between a religion of light and hope and faith in man, and one-more traditional-of mysticism and fatalism: the same contrast we have seen made both by Considérant and Belinsky.* From this point of view, it seems to me very likely that Dostoevsky meant The Landlady not only as a symbolic critique of Slavophilism but also of Orthodoxy, so far as he, like Belinsky, then saw the latter as a religion of fear or terror.

The book would have been the Romantic autobiography of an artist so beloved of novelists in the 1830s; and in choosing this old-fashioned genre as his model, Dostoevsky was following the same stylistic impulse that had led him to the sentimental-epistolary novel in Poor Folk, the Doppelgänger technique in The Double, and the Romantic folktale in The Landlady. In each case, he took a form that had become outmoded and attempted to revitalize it with a new, contemporary significance.

As she listens to Larya’s account of his life, “more and more I was illuminated by recognition,” she says. “And it was Larya who was chosen to explain all my grief to me through his own story” (2: 442).

Salvation for Dostoevsky would always depend on the capacity of the prideful ego (which later becomes identified with the prideful intellect) to surrender to the free self-sacrifice of love made on its behalf by Christ.

For us, Netotchka Nezvanova is primarily of interest because it sheds so much light on Dostoevsky’s internal evolution as a writer. There are, to begin with, a number of suggestions of future characters and motifs that may be added to those already noted in earlier chapters. Yefimov is evidently the prototype of all of Dostoevsky’s later “dreamers” and intellectuals, whose frustrated idealism (whether in relation to themselves or to mankind as a whole) will be allied to delusions of grandeur and to a similar inhumanity. The relation between Netotchka and Katya is a paradigm for what Dostoevsky’s greatest protagonists will later find so difficult to accomplish–the grateful surrender of pride to love and self-sacrifice. Peter Alexandrovich shows up again in the form of all the perfectly respectable and self-satisfied reprobates-Luzhin, Totsky, Velchaninov–who assume as their right the power to wreak havoc with female lives.

Even though the social position and relations of the characters serve to frame and motivate the action, Dostoevsky’s focus is no longer on external social conditions and their reflection in consciousness and behavior (as with Devushkin, Golyadkin, or Polzunkov). It is, rather, on the personal qualities that the characters display in the battle against the instinctive tendency of the injured ego to hit back for whatever social-psychic lesions and traumas it has been forced to endure.

Zweig’s portrait of Dostoevsky as a mad Russian genius–the Rasputin of literature, as it were–laid stress on epilepsy as a key to his enigmatic character; but Freud objects to the notion that Dostoevsky was a true epileptic. “Epilepsy is an organic brain disease independent of the psychic constitution,” he writes, “and as a rule associated with the deterioration and retrogression of the mental performance.” True epilepsy, in Freud’s view, always leads to mental degeneration (or almost always; the great scientist Helmholtz is cited as the single known counter-example). What is generally considered epilepsy in men of genius, according to Freud–who is here polemicizing with the then influential theory of Cesare Lombroso-are always “straight cases of hysteria.”

Freud, in any event, sees Dostoevsky’s character-pattern shaped by the combination of his Oedipal ambivalence and a strong bisexual disposition, later becoming transformed into a sadistic superego (the repressed hatred of the father) and a masochistic ego (the repressed wish to become the mother). The severity of a conflict between the two, Freud remarks, depends on “the accidental factor” of “whether the father, who is feared in any case, is also especially violent in reality.

Descartes advogava fortemente a favor do poder da razão em entender o mundo, uma filosofia hoje chamada de racionalismo, e que tinha Aristóteles e Leibnitz como membros. Descartes também era um proponente do dualismo. Ele sustentava que havia uma parte da mente humana (ou alma, ou espírito) que transcende a natureza, isenta das leis físicas. Por outro lado, os animais não possuem essa qualidade dual; eles podiam ser tratados como máquinas. Uma alternativa para o dualismo é o materialismo. O materialismo sustenta que a operação do cérebro de acordo com as leis da física constitui a mente. O livre-arbítrio é simplesmente o modo como a percepção das escolhas disponíveis se mostra para a entidade que escolhe.

Com base no trabalho de Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) e Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), o famoso Círculo de Viena, liderado por Rudolf Carnap (1891-1970), desenvolveu a doutrina do positivismo lógico. Essa doutrina sustenta que todo conhecimento pode ser caracterizado por teorias lógicas conectadas, em última análise, a sentenças de observação que correspondem a entradas sensoriais; desse modo, o positivismo lógico combina o racionalismo e o empirismo.3 A teoria da confirmação de Carnap e Carl Hempel (1905-1997) tentava compreender a aquisição do conhecimento através da experiência.

I do not know how it is now, but in my childhood I often used to see and hear these “shriekers” in villages and monasteries. Taken to the Sunday liturgy, they would screech or bark like dogs so that the whole church could hear, but when the chalice was brought out, and they were led up to the chalice, the “demonic possession” would immediately cease and the sick ones would always calm down for a time. As a child, I was greatly struck and astonished by this. And it was then that I heard from some landowners and especially from my town teachers, in answer to my questions, that it was all a pretense in order to avoid work, and that it could always be eradicated by the proper severity, which they confirmed by telling various stories. But later on I was surprised to learn from medical experts that there is no pretense in it, that it is a terrible woman’s disease that seems to occur predominantly in our Russia, that it is a testimony to the hard lot of our peasant women, caused by exhausting work too soon after difficult, improper birth-giving without any medical help, and, besides that, by desperate grief, beatings, and so on, which the nature of many women, after all, as the general examples show, cannot endure.

This strange and instant healing of the frenzied and struggling woman the moment she was brought to the chalice, which used to be explained to me as shamming and, moreover, almost as a trick arranged by the “clericals” themselves—this healing occurred, probably, also in a very natural way: both the women who brought her to the chalice and, above all, the sick woman herself, fully believed, as an unquestionable truth, that the unclean spirit that possessed the sick woman could not possibly endure if she, the sick woman, were brought to the chalice and made to bow before it. And therefore, in a nervous and certainly also mentally ill woman, there always occurred (and had to occur), at the moment of her bowing before the chalice, an inevitable shock, as it were, to her whole body, a shock provoked by expectation of the inevitable miracle of healing and by the most complete faith that it would occur. And it would occur, even if only for a moment.

The course itself was Aeronautics and Astronautics, and I didn’t – and still don’t, really – have an interest in aircraft. By rights I should have been aiming for a mechanical engineering degree, and if I’d wanted to end up in the automotive industry working on production-line cars then that’s what I’d have done. But I didn’t want a career in the automotive industry. I wanted a career in racing. My thinking was that an Aeronautics course would teach me aerodynamics and about the design of lightweight structures, about materials and control theory. I decided that because of that parallel technology with aircraft, and because of the lure of the wind tunnel, I’d aim for Southampton.

Thus, the aim of the chassis designer is to: One: ensure that the tyres are presented to the ground in an even and consistent manner through the braking, cornering and acceleration phases. Two: ensure the car is as light as possible. Three: ensure that the car generates as little drag as possible. Four: ensure that the car is generating as much downforce as possible in a balanced manner throughout the phases of the corner.

What attracted me to race engineering, besides the chance to learn something new, was the opportunity to combine that with being a designer and an aerodynamicist. I could influence the development of a car based on first-hand knowledge of its performance at the track. So say, for example, the driver was complaining of a handling problem. In the first instance I could talk to him in a race-engineering capacity and perhaps reduce the problem through the set-up of the car. But with an engineer’s eyes I could also hope to understand whether that problem was inherent to the mechanical design or the aerodynamic characteristics of the car. My understanding of the car would be complete.

So if the driver says the car’s understeering (i.e. that it’s tending to under-rotate and carry straight on, what the Americans call ‘push’) then there are all sorts of things you can do to try to solve that: you might add more front wing to increase front downforce; you might soften the front anti-roll bar, so there’s not as much weight transfer across the front tyres; you might change what the Americans call the ‘stagger’, the difference in diameter between the inside rear tyre and the outside rear tyre; you might alter the cross-weight, which is how weight is carried diagonally across the car, analogous to a wobbly bar table.

The car had a five-speed gearbox with fourth and fifth gears very close to one another. There was only 300 to 400rpm between them in terms of gearing, but if you needed every bit of performance, or conditions were slow, you’d select fourth for higher rpm, meaning more power from the engine. If you wanted to conserve the engine, you’d select fifth, lower rpm, less power but better reliability and fuel consumption.

Because of our level of dominance, Mario selected fifth gear. Unfortunately, that put the engine into a resonance area and 50 miles before the end it dropped a valve. Mario came into the pits running on seven cylinders and that was that, retired, which was absolutely soul-destroying. We’d been so dominant, done everything right, but 50 miles from the end of a 500-mile race, more than a lap ahead of the car in second place, we dropped out.

Our normally aspirated V8 was giving us 580 horsepower, so we were still a long way behind. However, the design of turbocharged cars had become clumsy. Complacent teams seemed to have settled for simply bolting ever-bigger front and rear wings onto the car, happy with the downforce and content that they had enough power to pull all that drag. Aerodynamically, the cars were quite dull and, in my opinion, less sophisticated than the Indy cars in this respect. On top of this, the turbo engines tend to be heavy installations, so teams were unable to get down to the weight limit.

Not only is a formal definition an implementation, an implementation can serve as a formal definition. When the first compatible computers were built, this was exactly the technique used. The new machine was to match an existing machine. The manual was vague on some points? "Ask the machine!" A test program would be devised to determine the behavior, and the new machine would be built to match. A programmed simulator of a hardware or software system can serve in precisely the same way. It is an implementation; it runs. So all questions of definition can be resolved by testing it.

What is the role of the producer? He assembles the team, divides the work, and establishes the schedule. He acquires and keeps on acquiring the necessary resources. This means that a major part of his role is communication outside the team, upwards and sideways. He establishes the pattern of communication and reporting within the team. Finally, he ensures that the schedule is met, shifting resources and organization to respond to changing circumstances. How about the technical director? He conceives of the design to be built, identifies its subparts, specifies how it will look from outside, and sketches its internal structure. He provides unity and conceptual integrity to the whole design; thus he serves as a limit on system complexity. As individual technical problems arise, he invents solutions for them or shifts the system design as required. He is, in Al Capp's lovely phrase, "inside-man at the skunk works." His communications are chiefly within the team. His work is almost completely technical.

In truth the development route I took and hence the car layout I drew is the one I would have drawn if I’d stayed at Leyton House. Sit a 1990 Leyton House alongside a Williams FW14 and you’ll see there’s a strong family similarity: the V-shaped chassis, the enclosed steering wheel underneath the small cockpit opening, the shape of the engine cover, front wing and endplates – all of it developed from the 901. My logic was simple: the 901 had finally proved itself to be a decent package to develop from and I knew that its wind tunnel numbers were significantly better than those of the FW13.

The principle of active suspension is to use an oil pump attached to the engine to generate hydraulic pressure. The hydraulic pressure is used to extend or shorten actuators at each wheel depending on what they need to do to achieve the desired ride-height. So if you brake hard, the front dives but the actuators at the front lengthen to compensate, and vice versa at the rear. It’s the same type of technology you see on the arm of a JCB digger.

The other thing I noticed from the wind tunnel results was that at very low ride-height the resulting stall of the diffuser reduced the drag of the car (due to reduction of what is known as ‘induced drag’, which is proportional to the lift or downforce of the vehicle). So we added a button to the steering wheel which, when pressed and held down, dropped the rear ride-height. The drivers used this in areas where they were power- rather than grip-limited (generally in the straights, but also, in Nigel’s case, for very fast corners such as Blanchimont at Spa, where, with sufficient courage, the car could still be held flat with no lift of the throttle even with the reduction of rear downforce). Effectively it was an early version of DRS.

Alain had gained the nickname ‘the professor’ for his very analytical approach to the sport, particularly his attention to detail in achieving a set-up that suited his ultra-smooth driving style. He was the opposite of the swashbuckling image of a racing driver, always very reserved and thoughtful, but quite nervy – often worrying at his fingernails, which were always bitten down to the quick. Unlike Nigel, who used to ‘bully’ the car, you never saw Alain’s car slide or step out of line. His progress seemed almost stately. You could be forgiven for thinking he was slow until you looked at the stopwatch to see that he’d recorded yet another great time. History tells us that he hadn’t lost any of that focus, which became evident at the first race.

Article 3.15 first became a feature of the regulations sometime after 1968, which was when cars began sprouting those ungainly looking aerodynamically adjustable wings mounted on huge struts at the top of the suspension uprights. The wings had caused a series of accidents – cars were literally taking off – so the FIA introduced Article 3.15, which said, ‘Bodywork must be rigidly attached to the entirely sprung part of the car and must remain immobile in relation to the sprung parts of the car.’

Now, in my opinion, the ‘must remain immobile’ part of this sentence was interpreted somewhat loosely, because what the FIA contended was that the pistons in our active suspension system were not remaining immobile relative to the sprung part of the car. But wait a minute: those pistons cannot be considered bodywork. No matter, it’s our bat and ball and we are telling you it is illegal.

The FW16, then, was an evolution of the FW15. Just as I always have and always will, I worked on the basis that if you have a car that seems to be a good concept, try to evolve that concept – don’t try to come up with a totally new one unless there is a very good reason.

Thankfully we had Damon in the cockpit, who had driven the 1993 car, and that was useful because it made us realise how much we’d lost through the ban on active suspension. It wasn’t that we’d produced a bad car as such. It was that we hadn’t produced a car that was well suited to passive suspension.

So to qualifying at São Paulo’s Interlagos circuit, nestled in the shadow of high-rises that stood like ramparts along the city skyline. Still having problems with the car – especially apparent on a bumpy circuit like Interlagos – Ayrton hung on, and thanks to his phenomenal control and ability managed to put the car on to pole, his starting position very much a measure of his ability rather than of our car’s superiority.

Officials had to be able to pass it between the driver and the inside of the cockpit, from his upper body down to the pedals. If this wasn’t possible, your car was declared illegal and excluded. If we lowered the steering column, then the template wouldn’t pass. The solution was to reduce the diameter of the steering column locally by 4mm, which is what we’d done.

Tamburello was where it happened. A fast left-hand corner shortly after the pits, it was typically taken flat-out, although most drivers, including Damon, were taking a slightly wider line in order to avoid the bumpy inside section. Ayrton, it seems, wasn’t doing that.

We reviewed what footage we had, and it was clear that the steering wheel had come off. You could see the wheel and the end of the steering column lying beside the car in the TV footage. The obvious conclusion was that the steering column had snapped and that was the cause of the accident.

Importantly, what we were able to ascertain was throttle position, brake pressure and steering torque, and what we saw appeared to substantiate the theory that it was a steering column failure, because it showed the steering column torque falling to near zero. In other words, there was no steering input during this phase. This could either mean that Ayrton had chosen not to steer, or that he was unable to steer because the steering column had failed.

Our feeling, however, that the steering column had been the main cause of the accident changed, however, when the FIA provided us with the on-board footage from Schumacher’s car. This indicated that the rear of Ayrton’s car had stepped out, which was the opposite to what would happen if the steering column had failed. Obviously, if the steering fails, you expect the car to carry straight on. But if the rear of the car steps out, that can only be from a loss of rear grip, not from a loss of front grip.

We were able to time-match Schumacher’s on-board footage with the data from the on-board computer, and what we established was that at the moment the rear of the car stepped out, Ayrton lifted his foot to about 40 per cent throttle and the steering torque dropped.

The only way we could achieve the column torques on the rig was with the column still reasonably intact and thus able to transmit torque due to the rotational inertia of the steering wheel – put simply, a completely broken column could not be made to register any steering column torque readings.

You question yourself. If you don’t, you’re a fool. The first thing you ask yourself is: Do I want to be involved in something where somebody can be killed as a result of a decision I have made? If you answer yes to that one, the second is: Do I accept that one of the design team for which I am responsible may make a mistake in the design of the car and the result of that mistake is that somebody may be killed? Prior to Imola, stupid as this may sound, I had never asked myself those questions.

So, in the immediate aftermath, Patrick and I discussed that and agreed we would have to go to a category system in which the safety-critical components, including the steering system, braking system, suspension parts and key aerodynamic components such as the front wing and rear wing – all the things that, if they failed, could cause an accident – should be submitted to an experienced stress engineer who would look at the drawings, make sure they were structurally sound and then countersign the drawing.

What I feel the most guilt about, though, is not the possibility that steering column failure may have caused the accident, because I don’t think it did, but the fact that I screwed up the aerodynamics of the car. I messed up the transition from active suspension back to passive and designed a car that was aerodynamically unstable, in which Ayrton attempted to do things the car was not capable of doing. Whether he did or didn’t get a puncture, his taking the inside, faster-but-bumpier line in a car that was aerodynamically unstable would have made the car difficult to control, even for him.

For Spain, we had two weeks’ notice to implement the new regulations, as well as to continue research on the short sidepod project we’d started just before Imola. Ironically, the required plank underneath the car helped to counter our aerodynamic instability, by forcing the car to run higher. Although we lost downforce, it made the problems we’d been wrestling with – with the front being very low, the rear high and the front of the sidepod coming too close to the ground and causing aerodynamic stall – less of a problem, because the sidepod was now 10mm higher than it had been before.

It’s all a bit of a game, to be honest. If I really want to look at a car, I need only wait until after the race, when the cars are held in parc fermé, where nobody’s allowed to touch them for an hour. They’re often parked right under your nose, and with all the mechanics busy packing up, you can look at them as much as you like.

It seemed to me that if you were going to try to reduce the load on the outside front tyre in the critical condition of combined entry, and reduce the load on the outside rear tyre under the critical condition of combined exit – remembering, particularly, that you now had a narrower car – then the way to compensate would be to lengthen the wheelbase. There were some who said that if the car was being made narrower, you should also make it shorter; that the length-to-width ratio should be preserved. But as I say, my feeling was no: you should do the opposite.

What McLaren had done in early 1997 was to take that trials car principle and apply it to a Formula One car. They put a fourth pedal in the footwell so that when the driver reached the middle of a slow-speed corner, where traditionally a car would understeer (push straight on), he would then press that fourth pedal to apply brake to the inside rear wheel. On the steering wheel was a switch to toggle, depending on whether it was a left-hand or a right-hand corner.

During 1993, Benetton had developed an electronically controlled rear-wheel steering system. However, fearing that this could become a significant driver aid, Max Mosley, as part of the swingeing restrictions introduced for the 1994 season, had Article 10 of the Technical Regulations changed to ban four-wheel steering, the intention being a ban on geometric steering of the rear wheels. As far as McLaren were concerned, however – and the governing body was happy to accept this – steering the car by using a fourth pedal was perfectly legal.

I was standing on the pit wall as usual. McLaren had seats in their pit, but I really didn’t like these, feeling more able to concentrate standing than sitting, so I had my seat removed during my time there. I was slightly concerned that this brake steer system could be overused by the drivers, causing overheating of the inside rear brake disk and hence leading to brake disc failure. I’d briefed both drivers to go easy on the fourth pedal – if we had sufficient pace not to need to use it, then please don’t. Unfortunately, going easy on the equipment doesn’t seem to translate into Finnish! Mika charged off and we could see on the telemetry that the inside rear brake disc was getting hot. We sent a coded radio message telling him to lay off the brake, but he was slightly deaf following a horrendous accident in 1995 (the one where Sid Watkins performed an emergency trackside tracheotomy), and somehow he heard the message as ‘pit now’, which he duly did.

In the meantime Marigold and I were firm that Harri’s schooling should come first, which put him at something of a disadvantage, for there is definitely a new breed of drivers who do the bare minimum in the way of academics in order to spend all their time at the track. To me that is a very high-risk strategy to adopt with your child: Lewis Hamilton is a shining example of this working, but for every success story associated with that route there are dozens of kids who reach 20 with no career and no education. Not only that, they have lost a normal childhood playing with children of their own age.

The engineering fraternity was divided: should we make significant modifications to the shape of the monocoque and the sidepod to allow the revised aerodynamics which I felt were essential to overcome the stability problems properly, or should we simply sort out the reliability problems and try to improve the performance of the unraced and unloved 18?

The one thing to get my creative juices flowing and keep me motivated in 2004 was the fact that we had quite a big regulation change coming up. In the FIA’s continual drive to slow the cars down, they decided to put further aerodynamic restrictions in place for the 2005 season, the main one being to raise the height of the front wing by 50mm. While that might not sound like a particularly big change, it is, because the aerodynamics of the front wing and the flow structures that come off it very much dictate the aerodynamics of the rest of the car.

In fact, if you had to pick the single most important aerodynamic component on the car, you’d say the front wing; it’s there to create front downforce and the trick is building a front wing that generates that downforce while creating the minimum amount of disruption to the flow over the rest of the car.

Also, I’d returned from a visit to the America’s Cup in Valencia with an idea. I’d discovered that because yachting teams are smaller and spend so long at the race venue, they effectively decamp and move there, lock, stock and barrel. After a day on the water, the sailing team would sit with factory-based engineers and discuss what they’d learnt, what they felt about the boat, where improvements could be made and so on. It struck me as a pleasant contrast to what so often happens in motor racing – and Jaguar/Red Bull was a good (i.e. bad) example of this – where there exists a dismissive ‘us vs them’ situation between the factory-based team and the race team, with race engineers often taking a rather high-handed ‘it’s our baby now’ approach to the car, which in turn infuriates the factory-based engineers. We started to think about setting up an Operations Room in Building One at Milton Keynes, and having it linked to a control room at the track. Instead of being restricted to five or six engineers at a race, the team could have access to all the expertise of the factory. These rooms would have full video-conferencing capability, so if there was a reliability problem with, say, the gearbox, the race team personnel could call the gearbox experts from the factory and talk about the problems using video communications coupled with a big network pipe, so that all the data we acquire on the car through the various sensors and on-board computer could be wired back to the factory in real time.

As a result I probably took it too gently in the first practice session.

Towards the end of 2005 Dietrich had acquired a second team from the bankrupt Minardi operation in Faenza, Italy, which he renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso. This was to serve as a driver-training team for the senior team, Red Bull Racing, as well as promoting Red Bull (the drink) in Italy, where sales were sluggish. Research and design of the cars was to be done by a third company, Red Bull Technology, for whom I work. Hence the Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso cars were identical designs for the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the only differences being that Toro Rosso used the Ferrari engine that we (RBR) had discarded at the end of 2006.

The downside of it is that, just as its corkscrew action pushes the lower part of the wheel wake outboard, it pulls the upper part of the front wheel wake inboard and onto the rear wing. With all this in mind, the design direction we took was to camber the front-wing endplates to get the tip vortex outside of the front wheel, as well as shaping the inboard end of the front wing to maximise and strengthen the 250 Vortex while keeping it stable.

On paper, the downforce was immense. Even if you went back to the original sliding-skirt ground-effect cars of the 1970s, the RB6 created more downforce than those; i.e. the most in Formula One history. This meant that Mark could take quick corners, like Copse at Silverstone – corners that previously would involve a change down a gear and a big lift, maybe even a brake – flat-out in top gear. We were up around 5G, the highest G a car’s ever pulled.

All our own fault. It was a mistake in design; we’d had the warning signs in testing but failed to take appropriate action. It was an example where, yes, we thought we’d fixed it, but we hadn’t properly stood back and understood the problem, so it caught us out.

Now we faced a dilemma. If we declared this system – which later became known as FRIC (front-rear interconnected suspension) – was aimed at improving the aerodynamics, it would be declared illegal in the same way as active suspension was banned. Fortunately, the system also reduced the pitch stiffness of the suspension system, improving the ride. Thus its prime purpose became ride improvement, which the FIA accepted. As a footnote, after many other teams adopted it, it was banned at the end of 2014 because its primary purpose was considered aerodynamic!

On to Suzuka, Japan, which is one of the classics, a high-speed track with very challenging corners, a scene of some great battles and one of the circuits I most enjoy visiting, not least because of the passion of the Japanese fans. You’ll arrive at the circuit in the morning to see fans already sitting in the grandstand. Long after the race, when our boys are getting the cars ready to be crated for the next race, fans will still be sitting in the grandstand, intently watching the boys pack the cars up. And yet, funnily, enough, the Japanese have never really provided the sport with great competitors, be it drivers or chassis designers. Why is that, you ask? I think for a Japanese team it’s quite difficult, because they’re based so far away from the hub of motorsport, which is the UK.

Most Formula One teams are in the UK and that becomes self-feeding, because if the teams are there, all the specialist suppliers tend to grow up around them. In terms of workforce, poaching people from another team becomes easier, because they probably don’t even have to move house if they’re living around Oxfordshire. It’s one of the reasons why Toyota, based in Germany, struggled. Sauber in Switzerland, the same problem. If you’ve grown up and lived in England, you probably aren’t going to want to go and live in Cologne or just outside Zurich.

To maximise that effect, what we needed was for the exhaust to be blowing all the time. Normally, of course, as the driver brakes, changes down and enters the corner, he’s completely off throttle and there’s next to no exhaust flow coming out of the back, which means that in that critical braking-and-entry phase you’re not getting effective downforce from the exhaust – when you most need it. What you ideally want is for the exhaust to be working hard, not only on corner exit, which it does naturally, but also on corner entry.

If you recall, KERS had been allowed in 2009, though very few teams had run it before it was banned altogether in 2010. The FIA performed another of their famous U-turns and decided to legalise it again, the reason being that the whole issue of energy recovery was very big in road cars at the time, and the FIA like to be seen as being in the vanguard of that.

We were looking dominant through practice and then fell foul of a stupid fuelling mistake during qualifying. The regulations stipulate that the car must have at least a litre of fuel left in it at the end of qualifying, which the FIA then drain and sample to make sure it complies with the regulations. In this particular case, Sebastian’s car had been short-fuelled and so during qualifying it ran out of fuel out on the circuit. Sebastian was excluded from qualifying and had to start from the pit lane. In the race itself, he did a great job of getting the car back through the field and he managed to finish third – a good piece of damage limitation – with Fernando finishing second.

Once we got into the swing of that dominance, the pressure was off, and in the end we cruised to four consecutive doubles which, no matter how many times you say it, is still difficult to believe: we won the double four times in a row! After which the sport changed – and not for the better in my opinion.

It’s not just my philosophy, of course; this is an ideology shared by Christian, and we had very much moulded the team around ideals we both shared. But speaking for myself, I felt that what I’d achieved at Red Bull was in many ways a means of giving something back to motor racing after motor racing had given so much to me. We’d introduced a team that was new, that was different, but that could get results. My work there offered fulfilment in a sport I had adored since childhood – a sport I’d loved, not always for what it was, but for what it had the potential to be: the total synchronicity of man and machine, the perfect combination of style, efficiency and speed.

Political protection is being used for personal enrichment, by stealing from the poor on behalf of the rich, a process known to economists and political scientists as rent-seeking. It is, in a sense, the opposite of free-market capitalism, and it is opposed by the Left, because of its distributional consequences, and the Right, because it undermines freedom and a truly free market.

Inequality is much cited for its baleful impacts. In this book, we see inequality as a consequence as much as a cause; if the rich are allowed to enrich themselves through unfair processes that hold down wages, and raise prices, then inequality will certainly rise. But not everyone gets rich that way. Some people invent new tools, drugs, or gadgets, or new ways of doing things, and benefit many, not just themselves. They profit from improving and extending other people’s lives. It is good for great innovators to get rich. Making is not the same as taking. It is not inequality itself that is unfair but rather the process that generates it.

The chance of dying increases with age, except at the very beginning of life. Life is most dangerous for babies and for the elderly. In rich countries, infancy is safe; only six out of one thousand American babies do not live to their first birthday, and other countries do even better. In Sweden and Singapore, for example, only two out of one thousand die. The risks are much higher in some poor countries, but even here, progress has been rapid, and there is not a single country in the world whose infant mortality rate is higher now than it was fifty years ago.

All deaths in the US are reported to the authorities, and the information is assembled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. When someone dies, a great deal of information is collected on the death certificate, including, for the last thirty years, the highest level of education attained. The CDC has a website, charmingly called CDC Wonder, where much of this information is readily available. The death certificates themselves, with confidential information (such as name and social security number) removed, can also be downloaded and examined. It is with these data that we begin.

If we are to begin to understand why these deaths are happening, we can first look for clues on where the deaths are happening. If we look across states at the changes in mortality rates for whites aged forty-five to fifty-four from 1999 to 2017, we find the increases in all but six states, with the largest increases in death rates in West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Mississippi, all states with education levels lower than the national average. The only states where midlife white mortality fell by a noticeable amount were California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, all states with high levels of education.

The midlife increase in mortality has now begun to affect the elderly, as the birth cohorts born after the Second World War begin to move into old age. The all-cause mortality rate for whites ages sixty-five to seventy-four fell on average 2 percent per year between the early 1990s and 2012; since 2012, their mortality has stopped falling.

There are two stories, often seen as competing, though they need not be. One, the “external” or circumstantial account, emphasizes what happened to people, the opportunities that they had, the kind of education, occupation, or social environment that was available to them. The alternative, “internal” account emphasizes what people did to themselves, not their opportunities but their choices among those opportunities, or their own preferences. It is a debate between worsening opportunities, on the one hand, and worsening preferences, or declining values or even virtues, on the other.

When we first saw an early version of the “coming apart” graph, we asked ourselves what people were dying of, which sent us back to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data to see what kinds of deaths had been rising most rapidly since 1999, the year white mortality rates began to rise. There were three immediate culprits. In order of importance, they were accidental or intent-undetermined poisonings (which are almost entirely drug overdoses), suicides, and alcoholic liver diseases and cirrhosis.

This puts the English-speaking world at odds with the rest of the rich world, where the risk of dying from heart disease in midlife continues to fall. Perhaps in the English-speaking world the improvements from prevention are running out, or perhaps as many people have quit smoking as are ever going to. But this cannot explain the poor performance of heart disease mortality in the United States, which was high by international standards in 1990, so that there ought to have been more room for improvement, not less.

The most obvious advantage of having gone to college is that you earn more, and with more money, you can live a better life. In the late 1970s, those with a bachelor’s degree or more earned on average 40 percent more than workers who left school with a high school diploma. But by 2000, that “earnings premium,” as economists call it, had doubled, to an astronomical 80 percent.

Many occupations that previously did not require a bachelor’s degree now do, so that the opportunities for those who do not go to college are shrinking just as the opportunities for those who have been to college are expanding. In 2017, at a time when the unemployment rate was only 3.6 percent, a historical low, the unemployment rate was almost twice as high among those with a high school diploma as it was among those with a bachelor’s degree. Eighty-four percent of Americans ages twenty-five to sixty-four with a bachelor’s degree or higher were employed in 2017, while only 68 percent of those with a high school diploma but no additional education were employed.

As with the less educated, the risk of a death of despair rises with age, at least until age sixty, but each cohort seems to be aging almost along the same trajectory. If we look closely, we can see that there are (much smaller) differences across cohorts and that here, too, later-born cohorts are doing slightly worse. But, in the language of the demographers, there are no or only very small “cohort effects”; each cohort is aging along the same profile.

From 1990, black mortality resumed its progress so that, when white mortality stopped falling in the late 1990s, the gap closed rapidly. Reducing the gap is most welcome, but it would have been much more so had it come more from increasingly rapid progress among blacks and less from the stalling of progress among whites.

The increase in black mortality in the most recent years comes from an interaction between the current opioid epidemic and the earlier drug epidemic in the black community. As we shall see in chapter 9, the epidemic has most recently been driven by fentanyl, an opioid that is much more powerful and dangerous than heroin. The earlier drug epidemic among blacks had left a substantial number of long-term but stably functioning addicts in the black community. But when dealers started mixing fentanyl with heroin and cocaine, those long-term addicts started dying; a customarily safe dose had, without the victim’s knowledge, become a lethal cocktail.

From the low point of black mortality from all causes (in 2014), increases in death rates involving synthetic narcotics (like fentanyl) can fully account for the increase in mortality observed for those aged forty-five to fifty-four.

Drug overdoses and alcohol-related liver mortality caused many deaths among blacks in the earlier epidemic, and among whites in the current one. But in deaths from suicide, the parallel breaks down. African Americans are much less likely to kill themselves than are white Americans; their suicide rates in midlife have changed little in the past fifty years and are currently about a quarter of those for whites.

The ratio is not fixed and differs by age, but the much lower rate for blacks has long been the case and was noted as early as 1897 by Emile Durkheim in his foundational book on suicide.3 There is no widely accepted explanation for the difference. George Simpson, in his introduction to an English translation of Durkheim’s book, summarizes Durkheim’s view that perhaps “systematic oppression and underprivilege lead individuals to be adjusted to the misery and tragedy of human existence which is visited upon us all.”4 He also notes something else that remains relevant today: the lower suicide rate of blacks shows that underprivilege alone is not a cause of suicide.

In both epidemics, drugs that could ease psychological or physical pain were available at an (arguably) affordable price to populations that were hungry for the escape that they seemed to offer. During the crack epidemic, the inner city offered few legitimate avenues of progress. In the opioid crisis, it is less educated whites, many of whom do not see a promising economic future, or a promising future in any aspect of their lives, who are falling prey to drugs, alcohol, and suicide. We should also not exaggerate the similarities, especially when we are comparing blacks and whites today.

The idea that the fundamental malady was not lack of opportunity was taken up by the political scientist Charles Murray in Losing Ground, which also argued that welfare benefits designed to combat poverty were undermining work and helping create the dysfunctional behavior. Murray’s later book, Coming Apart, attributes many of the current problems of less educated whites to their own failures of virtue, particularly a failure of industriousness, meaning that they are no longer interested in working for a living or in supporting their families.10

In chapter 11, we look at the labor market and will show that Murray’s thesis cannot explain what has happened recently for less educated whites. If people are withdrawing their labor, wages should rise; but in the late part of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, wages fell along with employment, a clear indication that the problem lies with falling demand, not falling supply.

As to the earlier episode, we endorse Wilson’s view that “conservative assertions about underclass life and behavior were weakened because of a lack of direct evidence and because they seemed to be circular in the sense that cultural values were inferred from the behavior of the underclass to be explained, and then these values were used as the explanation of the behavior.”

Some are measured at an annual physical examination. Samples of blood and urine give indicators of cholesterol, diabetes, and heart, kidney, and liver function. Your physician or another medical professional will also measure the four “vital signs”: blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, and rate of respiration. In recent years, it has become common for physicians to ask about pain, sometimes called the fifth vital sign, a topic to which we will return.

But when you go to the doctor for your physical, or with a medical issue, the results are not centrally recorded, so there is no national register of obesity, hypertension, or cholesterol, just to give some examples. For people treated under Medicare, medical records are centrally stored, but these records are short of information on the characteristics of the patients, so while they tell us a lot about conditions, treatments, and costs, they are much less informative about the personal attributes of those being treated. In some Scandinavian countries that have government-provided healthcare, all encounters are recorded, and those data can be linked, at least in principle, with other data about individuals—for example, about their education, marital history, income, and taxes.

Over the same period, older whites, aged sixty or over, were reporting better health, with a smaller and smaller fraction saying that their health was fair or poor. By 2017, for those without a bachelor’s degree, adults above age sixty were reporting better health than were those in their late fifties. This puzzling result comes from presenting different birth cohorts in the same figure. Among those without a bachelor’s degree, later-born birth cohorts are reporting worse health at each age than did the cohorts that came before them, which gives rise to the anomalous-looking result.

That the increase in poor health between survey years holds only for those without a bachelor’s degree speaks against there having been a simple change in how birth cohorts assess their health, with later-born cohorts being more sensitive, say, to pain or chronic conditions, leading them to report worse health. If that were true, we would expect to see the same change for those with a four-year college degree.

The fraction of whites without a bachelor’s degree who express difficulty in going out to do things like shop or go to the movies and the fraction finding it hard to relax at home have increased by 50 percent for those aged twenty-five to fifty-four, and the fraction finding it difficult to socialize with friends has nearly doubled in this twenty-year period. The inability to socialize with friends not only removes one of life’s most pleasurable and important activities but also puts people at risk for suicide.

As is true for self-reports of physical and mental health, shown in figures 6.1 and 6.2, there are dramatic differences here by education. For those aged forty-five to fifty-four, historically the peak earning years, the percentage of whites reporting that they were unable to work rose from 4 percent in 1993 to 13 percent in 2017 for those without a bachelor’s degree. The percentage for those with a four-year degree was initially low and remained so, between 1 and 2 percent.

These connections are consistent with the account that we have come to favor, which is that the increase in pain among less educated Americans can be traced back to the slow disintegration of their social and economic lives, and that the pain is, in turn, one of the links through which disintegration leads to suicide and addiction. The story of a death of despair often passes through pain.

The different patterns of pain by age can be reconciled once we realize that there has been a large recent upsurge of pain in midlife among whites without a bachelor’s degree. The elderly in the figure did not experience this upsurge, and if we had tracked them through life, they would not have shown the midlife peak. Similarly, although we cannot do it until we get data from the future, we suspect that if we were to track today’s midlife adults as they age, their pain will turn out to be much higher than the pain of today’s elderly, a deeply depressing prediction. Midlife adults are suffering unusual amounts of pain today, but it is nothing compared with what they will feel when they are old.

There is no sign in this picture of pain reversal at age sixty within any birth cohort, though the reversal seen in figure 7.2 would be seen here if we were to look across cohorts in any given year. For those without a bachelor’s degree, pain increases with age, but those born later have more pain throughout their lives. Those born between 1930 and 1939, shown on the extreme right of the left panel, experience more pain as they age, observed at age sixty and above. The next line, for those born between 1940 and 1949, rises in much the same way, but the fraction reporting pain is higher at all ages. For those without a bachelor’s degree, each successive birth cohort experiences more pain.

There are experiments showing that the pain experienced by social exclusion works similarly in the brain to the pain experienced by an injury.

All three kinds of deaths of despair involve the actions of those who die, most obviously in suicide—self-inflicted death—but also from taking drugs or drinking too much or for too long. Long ago, Emile Durkheim argued that to understand suicide—and the same could be argued for other deaths of despair—we must look beyond the individual to society, particularly to breakdown and turmoil in a society that can no longer provide its members an environment in which they can live a meaningful life.

It has long been understood that classifying a death as a suicide is extraordinarily difficult, and that the number of suicides is almost certainly underestimated in the statistics. Suicide carries stigma, and families resist the label; for much of history, felo-de-se was a crime, punishable by forfeiture of assets and prohibition of decent burial.

Unemployment, including perhaps the fear of becoming unemployed, has been found to predict suicide. Detachment from the labor force is also a risk. Both fit the Durkheim story of social upheaval and suicide; indeed, Durkheim thought that “economic crises” caused suicide, though his definition of an economic crisis included not only slumps but also booms. It was the disruption that mattered, up or down, not the level of income itself, and this may be why the effects of income on suicide are less clear-cut.

Gallup also asks, “Has drinking ever been a cause of trouble in your family?” The percentage saying yes was around 15 percent in 1948 and 12 percent in the early 1970s, but it has risen markedly since then to more than 33 percent in 2018, the highest number recorded.

Consuming many drinks in a short period of time (“binge-like” drinking) with lower frequency is more dangerous to the liver than moderate daily drinking, putting those with less education at higher risk for alcoholic liver diseases. Echoing this, we are beginning to see deaths from alcoholic liver diseases rising among whites in their late twenties and early thirties.

Alcohol was implicated in another recent episode of mortality, not in the US but in Russia, before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Alcohol consumption was (and is) extraordinarily high in Russia. In the early 1980s, annual consumption of pure alcohol was more than fourteen liters per person per year, almost twice as much as in the United States.

What should we make of this Russian story? Many commentators have connected the Russian mortality crisis to the social upheaval that came with the dissolution of the old order, a perfect Durkheimian story. We suspect that this is true, but the role of alcohol, the Gorbachev campaign, and its subsequent collapse is widely accepted and needs to be taken into account. Some of the spike in mortality was the rebound of deaths that had been temporarily postponed by the campaign, and there was nothing to stop the rebound from being larger than the original effect. But many other bad things happened at the same time as the collapse of the state. Many elderly people lost their pensions and their access to healthcare.25 And while many young people relished the new opportunities for foreign travel and education, there was little but despair left for their grandparents, who had no opportunity left to start a new life; in all of the countries of the former Soviet Union and its satellites, there is a huge gap between the young and the elderly in how they evaluate their lives.26

Opioids are either the natural derivatives of the opium poppy, such as opium itself and morphine, which have been used for thousands of years and are technically referred to as opiates, or synthetic or partially synthetic compounds that have some or all of the same properties, technically known as opioids.

In the late 1990s, thinking about pain management changed. As we have seen, there was (and still is) a great deal of pain in the US. Pain-relief advocates argued that the US was undertreating pain, and enormous quantities of very powerful opioids were unleashed on the American population.

Opioids prescribed by physicians accounted for fully a third of all opioid deaths in 2017, and a quarter of the 70,237 drug overdose deaths that year. This overall number is greater than the peak annual number of deaths from HIV, from guns, or from automobile crashes. It is greater than the total number of Americans who died in Vietnam. The cumulative total from 2000 to 2017 is greater than the total number of Americans who died in the two world wars. The overuse of prescription opioids triggered the secondary epidemic of illegal drugs when Purdue introduced an abuse-resistant form of OxyContin and as physicians became more aware of the dangers and held back, or at least reduced the growth of the legal supply.

Producers made huge sums of money from legal opioids. According to various reports, including investigative work by the Los Angeles Times, Purdue Pharmaceutical, which is privately owned by the Sackler family, has sold somewhere between $30 and $50 billion worth of OxyContin. Recently released court documents show that the family itself received $12 billion or $13 billion.9 Illegal drug dealers, many from Mexico, have also prospered,10 but legal producers have the advantage of not having arrest or violence as a routine business risk.

Physicians are also implicated in the epidemic and, at the least, have been guilty of careless overprescribing, especially in the early days of the epidemic. A substantial fraction of opioid deaths was caused by the American healthcare system; the standard term for such deaths is iatrogenic, meaning “brought forth by the healer.” It is one of the ironies of the epidemic that the US healthcare system, by far the most expensive in the world, not only is failing to prevent the decline in life expectancy but is actually contributing to its fall. And as we shall see in chapter 13, this is not only a result of its mishandling of opioids.

The term epidemic invites comparison with an epidemic of smallpox or the influenza epidemic that killed millions in the US and around the world in 1918–19. In the opioid epidemic, the agents were not viruses or bacteria but rather the pharmaceutical companies that manufactured the drugs and aggressively pushed their sales; the members of Congress who prevented the DEA from prosecuting mindful overprescription; the DEA, which acceded to lobbyists’ requests not to close the legal loophole that was allowing importation of raw material from poppy farms in Tasmania that had been planted to feed the epidemic; the FDA, which approved the drugs without considering the broad social consequences of doing so and which acceded to producer requests to approve label changes that greatly widened use and profits; the medical professionals who carelessly overprescribed them; and the drug dealers from Mexico and China who took over when the medical profession began to pull back.

During the Nixon administration, there were reports from Congressmen Robert Steele and Morgan Murphy, who on an official visit to Vietnam in 1971 found that servicemen were using heroin. Nixon immediately declared that heroin addiction was the nation’s number one public health problem. Servicemen could be compelled to take urine tests, and the results—in line with the soldiers’ own reports—showed that 34 percent had tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted. Much to the surprise of the investigators, 38 percent were using opium. (More than 90 percent used alcohol, and three-quarters used marijuana.) Those who tested positive were detoxed and urine-tested before being allowed to go home, a powerful incentive to get clean. The program became known as Operation Golden Flow, and its veterans were followed up once they got home. Only 12 percent returned to opioid addiction in the US within three years; in most of those cases, the readdiction was brief.

The supply side of the epidemic was important—the pharma companies and their enablers in Congress, the doctors who were imprudent with their prescriptions—but so was the demand side—the white working class, less educated people, whose already distressed lives were fertile ground for corporate greed, a dysfunctional regulatory system, and a flawed medical system. The opioid epidemic did not happen in other countries both because they had not destroyed their working class and because their pharmaceutical companies are better controlled and their governments are less easily influenced by corporations seeking profits.

The benefits of free-market capitalism are often rightly noted, including its ability to give people what they want, its incentives for innovation, and its ability to promote economic growth. We agree. But the American medical system, including the pharmaceutical industry, is nothing like a free market. The existence of moneymaking corporations does not imply competitive free markets. Instead, these highly regulated corporations are largely concerned with seeking protective regulations from government and government agencies to protect their profits and limit competition in a way that would be impossible in a free market.

From that time on Adolf’s father was legally known as Alois Hitler, and the name passed on naturally to his son. It was only during the 1930s that enterprising journalists in Vienna, delving into the parish archives, discovered the facts about Hitler’s ancestry and, disregarding old Johann Georg Hiedler’s belated attempt to do right by a bastard son, tried to fasten on the Nazi leader the name of Adolf Schicklgruber.

The new bride, Klara Poelzl, who would shortly become the mother of Adolf Hitler, was twenty-five, her husband forty-eight, and they had long known each other. Klara came from Spital, the ancestral village of the Hitlers. Her grandfather had been Johann von Nepomuk Huetler, with whom his nephew, Alois Schicklgruber-Hitler, had grown up. Thus Alois and Klara were second cousins and they found it necessary, as we have seen, to apply for episcopal dispensation to permit the marriage.

He died in infancy, as did the second child, Ida, born in 1886. Adolf was the third child of this third marriage. A younger brother, Edmund, born in 1894, lived only six years. The fifth and last child, Paula, born in 1896, lived to survive her famous brother.

We resist the notion that income inequality is like pollution in the air, or deadly radiation, so that living in a more unequal society is something that sickens everyone, rich and poor alike. For one thing, the huge expansion of income inequality in the US came after 1970, precisely during the period when mortality was falling rapidly and life expectancy rising rapidly (see figure 1.1). Beyond that, although some states in America are much less equal than others, the epidemic of deaths of despair is no worse in less equal states. New Hampshire and Utah, two states with the lowest levels of income inequality, have been much harder hit than New York and California, two states with the highest.
